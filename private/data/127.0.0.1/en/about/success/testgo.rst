Introduction
------------

When one of the French Government Agencies was looking for a way to overcome
their growing data quality problems, they chose to use the `Test&Go <http://www.qualicontrol.com/eng/testandgo/?page=concept_eng&logo=logo_tg.jpg>`_ software
suite from `QualiControl <http://www.qualicontrol.com/eng/default.php>`_, along with associated consultancy, to help them
develop a solution.

The problem was the following: every year, over a period of one month, more
than 800,000 French companies sent their employee year-end reports in
electronic form. More than 35% of these reports had errors or exceptions, and
reports highlighting these exceptions had to be sent back to the originating
company for correction of the data, before again being sent back to the
Agency. This process was repeated until the data received was free of any
critical errors, causing the whole *submission-validation-correction* cycle to
last up to six months.

Solution
--------

In order to resolve this problem, the Agency had several options to choose
between. These options included writing their own application, outsourcing the
problem, or using a market solution. After evaluating the cost and development
times of each, they decided to pick Test&Go as a combined solution for the
following reasons:

The Test&Go Integrated Development Environment allowed for very rapid
development and testing of a solution. Visual programming in Test&Go made it
very intuitive and efficient to use.

Test&Go used Python as a scripting language. The choice of Python as a
development language initially seemed a risky one to the Agency, but its fast
learning curve, tremendous power, supportive user community and broad range of
books on the subject, quickly convinced them it was the right choice.

The initial script development was done as a joint development between the
Agency and QualiControl. The project was done in this way to help the Agency
develop a solution in the shortest time possible, with simultaneous training
and consulting. This resulted in a script containing over 940 standard Test&Go
validation controls, enhanced with more than 5,000 lines of Python code. Total
development and testing was completed in approximately one month, instead of
the six months that would have been required if taking a traditional
development approach.

The Agency decided to deploy a stand-alone script to 40,000 of the companies
that had encountered problems the previous year.

Results
-------

The implementation of the Test&Go script met with enormous success. The
following year the rejection rate for the companies submitting data, validated
using Test&Go, was reduced from 35% to 5%, and the total processing time was
halved to three months. The rejection rate could not be reduced further at the
time as not all validations could be done at source, i.e. on the client site,
because access was required to certain internal databases at the Agency.

Following a very successful pilot phase the Agency is currently deploying its
script using the eTest&Go Server and Web Services technologies, allowing them
to reach even more companies, and further reduce the rejection rate and
processing times.
