- The Python Bug Tracker has a search form.

Where to search?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- If you're looking for a particular module or a module to do a particular thing, use the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_
- If you have a problem installing or using Python, the best place to start is the FAQ (listed above), followed by the newsgroups, and then the SIG archives.  If you get a specific error message that you don't understand, try entering the entire error message (in double quotes is usually best) as a query, but leaving out any obviously variable parts (like a pathname on your system or a module name you just entered).
