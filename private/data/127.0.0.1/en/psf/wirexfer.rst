Making Donations by Wire Transfer
=================================

The PSF can accept donations and payments over $50 by wire transfer to its
bank account. Please note there are fees of up to $30 for receiving wire
transfers in the US, so donating by credit card or other
means is often a better choice for smaller amounts.  For large amounts, 
donating by wire transfer is often better (credit cards take about 2.4%).

Please `contact us </psf/about>`_ to obtain the necessary details.
We will need to know whether you plan a SWIFT or ACH transfer, and may require
some verification of your identity before releasing the information.
