Python Press Releases
=====================

Because the PSF is a membership organization, PSF news is usually
sent to a members mailing list, or posted on this web site.  The PSF
may also issue press releases from time to time, for news of general
interest.  In addition, some press releases issued by other
organizations relevant to Python are listed below.
