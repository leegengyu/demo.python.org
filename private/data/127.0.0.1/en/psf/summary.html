<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><em>?The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the
growth of the international community of Python programmers.?</em></p>
<p>The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is the non-profit legal entity that holds
and protects the intellectual property rights behind Python, keeping it free
and open for all to use. The PSF also contributes to the Python community by
underwriting or sponsoring conferences, funding grants and special projects,
and leading volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>Everyone that programs with Python should know at least a little about the
PSF, especially how the Python license and trademarks work. While this may
seem boring to many programmers, there is much that an aware Python users base
can do to help protect Python, and keep the community behind Python vital and
productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="organization">
<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>The PSF was formed in 2001 as a non-profit corporation in the state of
Delaware, USA. Although it was formed in the US, the PSF's mission is
world-wide, extending to wherever there are Python programmers. Its membership
is international, including individuals that have played a significant role in
the Python community and companies that sponsor the PSF because they have an
investment in Python. Both individual and sponsor members have voting rights
in the organization and thus are selected based on their ability to take part
in the PSF's stewardship role. It is the existing members that vote to accept
new individual and sponsor members to the organization.</p>
<p>The officers and board of directors of the PSF take care of most of the
day-to-day business of running the organization. The board of directors is
voted in by the members and the officers are appointed by the board. Some of
the officers are paid a small salary since their work requires constant
availability and many hundreds of hours of effort per year. The other officers
and directors are unpaid volunteers. Currently, we have officers and board
members in the US, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p>The board of directors meets monthly, via IRC, and the PSF members meet once a
year in person at the North American PyCon conference. Members that cannot be
present in person at the annual meeting can vote by ballot submitted ahead of
time or by proxy (assigning their vote to someone they trust).</p>
<p>More information, including the membership roster and public records, is
available at <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/psf">http://python.org/psf</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="financial-overview">
<h1>Financial Overview</h1>
<p>The PSF is funded from a variety of sources. For example, in 2006 a total of
$168K in revenues came from: Individual donors (13%), PSF sponsor fees (17%),
PyCon registration and PyCon sponsor fees (51%), participation in the Google
Summer of Code program (14%), and interest on investments and other minor
sources (5%).</p>
<p>In 2006 the PSF spent $158K total, for: PyCon 2006 related expenses (67%),
funded grants (13%), the advocacy special project (10%), payroll for officers
(5%), and other expenses such as bank charges, legal fees, and insurance (5%).</p>
<p>The PSF's assets currently stand at about $310K. A healthy balance enables the
foundation to take on the financial risk of underwriting PyCon each year, and
provides a reserve for any unexpected expenses, legal or otherwise.</p>
<p>The PSF has obtained the status of 501(c)3 non-profit, which makes
contributions from individuals deductible from US federal taxes. The PSF is
not yet officially registered as a non-profit in other countries. However, in
many cases, donations and sponsor fees paid by a business are also pre-tax,
but this depends on local rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="licensing">
<h1>Licensing</h1>
<p>Python is licensed under a &quot;stack&quot; of open source licenses, which represent
its history as an open source project under the sponsorship of a number of
different organizations. The topmost license on this stack is the PSF License
(<a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.org/licenses/PythonSoftFoundation.php">http://opensource.org/licenses/PythonSoftFoundation.php</a>). Everything added to
Python since version 2.0.1 is covered by the PSF License, while some older
portions of the code are covered by the older licenses lower down on the
stack.</p>
<p>For most users, the details of the license stack are irrelevant. All of the
licenses grant permission to use, modify, and redistribute the code in an
non-restrictive way. However, it is a good idea to have a basic understanding
of how the licensing works, how it relates to copyright ownership, and what
factors make an open source release legally valid.</p>
<p>In fact, the PSF does not directly own the copyright to any of the Python
source code. The copyrights are retained by the organizations and individuals
that contributed the code. The PSF obtains its rights through licensing. An
important concern here is that the licensing was made by those that had a
legal right to do so, in other words by the original authors or copyright
holders of the code.</p>
<p>The legal history of the code in Python is thus defined in two ways:</p>
<p>(1) In the earlier days of Python, employee contracts and related law ensured
that the organizations that released Python under the various licenses had the
rights to the code that was added in each release. The open source licenses
used by those organizations granted all the necessary rights to the world in
general, which of course includes the PSF. The only significant right the PSF
does not have to this code is to re-license it. This is the reason for the
continued existence of the older licenses in the license stack. Since some of
the organizations involved no longer exist, it is unlikely that the PSF could
obtain relicensing rights in the future. Thus, the older licenses cannot be
removed from the license stack.</p>
<p>(2) For newer contributions, including all those since the PSF License was
introduced, the PSF obtains the necessary rights to the code first from the
author through a contribution agreement. The author licenses the code to the
PSF under one of several specially selected open source licenses and
simultaneously signs an agreement that gives the PSF the right to relicense
the code without restriction. The code is then re-licensed under the PSF
License.</p>
<p>The initial licenses that accompany the contribution currently can be either
the Academic Free License version 2.1 or the Apache License version 2.0. These
were selected because they contain a patent clause and avoid unnecessary
restrictions on the licensee.</p>
<p>The important thing to note here is that the PSF can demonstrate that Python
contains only code licensed to it by organizations and individuals that had
the necessary rights to the code in order to make that license legally valid.
Python's case is further strengthened by the existence of an intact revision
control record that dates back to its very beginning, and extensive email and
other records that help to establish when and by whom the code was developed.
This body of evidence makes any legal claim against Python's open source
status difficult and very unlikely to succeed.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="trademarks">
<h1>Trademarks</h1>
<p>The PSF also holds and protects the trademarks behind the Python programming
language. This includes the &quot;Python&quot; name, when used in the domain of
programming languages, and also the Python logos. &quot;Python&quot; is a registered
trademark in the US, while the logos have not yet been registered.</p>
<p>There is much confusion about the nature and purpose of trademarks, and they
are often incorrectly viewed as incompatible with open source. This is simply
not true. Trademarks are another way to help keep Python free and open for all
to use, and protecting the trademarks helps to prevent confusion about the
nature and purpose of Python.</p>
<p>For example, if an entirely different programming language were named &quot;Python&quot;
or even &quot;Python Plus&quot;, it could cause considerable confusion, making life more
difficult for the developers and users of either language. Any other Pythons
should be the same programming language, within reason, even if they implement
the language differently as do IronPython and Stackless Python.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Python logos must refer only to the Python programming language
and they should not be modified in any way (color, font, shape, etc.) as this
can cause confusion. It dilutes the &quot;brand&quot; that helps to make Python
distinctive and identifiable to the user (the &quot;consumer&quot;).</p>
<p>In fact, trademarks are intended primarily as a way to protect the consumer,
and the burden of keeping the trademark clear of confusion falls to the
trademark owner. Because of this, the PSF has no choice but to defend the
Python related trademarks. Failing to do so would mean that we lose rights to
the marks and would be unable to prevent use of the name for another
programming language, or misleading uses such as those that obscure the fact
that Python is open source.</p>
<p>Because Python is free and open, our enforcement of the trademarks is indeed
mostly about avoiding confusion and not at all about holding the trademarks
close as would be done with some proprietary marks. We want the trademarks to
be used as widely as possible. This includes also the unaltered logos, which
are often used to indicate suitability for Python or implementation in Python.</p>
<p>One important and useful idea that applies to trademarks in general is the
notion of &quot;nominative use&quot; of the trademark. A trademark can always be used to
name the trademarked entity itself so long as the use does not imply some
special relationship with the trademark holder. Thus, the word &quot;Python&quot; can be
used anywhere to refer to Python without asking the PSF for permission,
regardless of whether or not the use is commercial.</p>
<p>The PSF has extended the idea of nominative use also to the unaltered Python
logos, making it possible to use the logos in most contexts without any
special permission. Again, we want the trademarks to be used widely.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="pycon-and-other-conferences">
<h1>PyCon and Other Conferences</h1>
<p>In 2003, the Python community started to run its own low-cost
developer-focused Python conference called PyCon. This conference format
proved to be quite successful and the conference has experienced substantial
growth in size and offerings each year. The original PyCon conference is held
in North America. In 2007, PyCon-style conferences were added in Italy, the UK
and Brasil.</p>
<p>The PSF has been closely involved with the North American PyCon since its
creation. It provides the financial backing that is necessary to plan and run
the conference, and has helped in other ways, for example by providing grants
to pay need-based travel expenses for selected attendees ($6.2K in 2007).</p>
<p>Any profit or loss from the conference is absorbed by the PSF. To keep the
conference affordable, the organizers attempt to break even or sustain a small
loss. However, due to the continued unexpected growth in the conferences, each
of the five conferences held so far has turned a profit. For example, PyCon
2007 drew in 593 attendees (seven short of the venue's limit) and an
unexpected six platinum sponsors, as well as sixteen other sponsors. While the
registration fee for attendees is set below the cost of running the
conference, the added sponsor fees more than made up the difference each year.</p>
<p>While unintended, turning a profit at PyCon has helped the PSF build a reserve
fund which now makes it possible to take on the significant financial
commitment of booking ever-larger conference venues.</p>
<p>More recently, PSF has started to fund some other Python conferences by
sponsoring (or donating funds to) the organizations that run the conferences.
In 2007 this included EuroPython ($5K), PyCon Italia (1.5K Euros), PyCon UK
($2.5K) and the Argentinian Python conference ($500).</p>
<p>The PSF will continue to provide support for Python conferences around the
world, certainly by making donations to each event and possibly also by
underwriting the major financial commitments made by these other
community-organized conferences as they grow.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="grants-program">
<h1>Grants Program</h1>
<p>In 2004, the PSF issued its first call for grant proposals, with a total
budget of $40K. In response to that call, over 60 proposals were submitted.
Three of them were selected for funding:</p>
<p><strong>Software Carpentry (Greg Wilson, $27K)</strong> ? an intensive introductory course
in basic software development practices for scientists and engineers. The
proposed portion of the work was completed in October 2006 and the course is
still actively being improved and expanded. For details, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.swc.scipy.org/">http://www.swc.scipy.org/</a></p>
<p><strong>Implementation of PySNMPv3 (Ilya Etingof, $1.5K)</strong> ? an SNMP library for
Python. This was completed in October 2005. For details, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/">http://pysnmp.sourceforge.net/</a></p>
<p><strong>Moving Jython Forward (Brian Zimmer, $10K)</strong> -- to bring Jython up to date
with CPython. Due to unexpected changes in the proposer's career, the work for
this grant was only partially completed, and only a subset of the funding
($2.3K) was paid. Even so, the Jython project has seen progress with the
release of version 2.2 in August 2007. For details, see <a class="reference external" href="http://jython.org/">http://jython.org/</a></p>
<p>This initial experiment with a formal grant process, although largely
successful, has not yet been repeated because of the amount of volunteer labor
that the grant review and oversight process consumed.</p>
<p>The PSF board is, however, always open to receiving proposals for funded work,
which will be considered along with our other initiatives. Proposals that are
likely to be successful are those that will bootstrap a new project or
sub-section of the Python community in a relatively cost effective manner.
Projects that won't be maintained after the funding ends are unlikely to be
considered.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="special-project-python-org-redesign">
<h1>Special Project: python.org redesign</h1>
<p>The PSF has funded several special projects outside of the formal grants
process. One of these was the redesign of the python.org website in 2005 and
2006. This included the graphic design for the site and Python logo,
repackaging of the site content in a uniform format, and development of a new
build system for the site.</p>
<p>The rationale for funding this change was that the volunteer site maintainers
did not have the time available to make these major labor-intensive changes
and the community had failed to agree on several earlier redesign attempts
(both graphical design and improvement of the technology behind the site).</p>
<p>Yet, a general consensus existed that the old site needed some intensive work.</p>
<p>This contract (valued at 4K GBP) was awarded to the proposer, Tim Parkin of
Pollenation. The graphical design and the repackaging of content (with help
from volunteers during the 2006 PyCon Sprints) were both successful. The new
general purpose build system, called Pyramid, was however found to be slow,
complicated, and hard to install. This made it difficult for volunteers to be
able to get started with maintaining the site. Some improvements were made,
but ultimately Pyramid was replaced with a much simpler and faster build
system that is custom-designed for python.org.</p>
<p>Despite these initial problems with the build software, this project was a
success. The look of the site has been improved and moving to a CSS based
design and uniform content format will make any future changes in design or
toolset much easier.</p>
<p>To compare the new and old designs, visit <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org/">http://python.org/</a> and

<p>Looking ahead, there is still much work to be done in improving the site,
adding and keeping content up to date, and even rethinking some of the
structure and presentation (for example, to make it more accessible to new
Python users, or to allow annotation). Please consider volunteering as a site
maintainer.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="special-project-advocacy-coordinator">
<h1>Special Project: Advocacy Coordinator</h1>
<p>Another special project undertaken by the PSF was the funding of a paid
Advocacy Coordinator for 13 months during 2006 and 2007 ($46K total). This was
a proposal from Jeff Rush, who had played a significant role in the
organization and promotion of the 2006 and 2007 PyCons. The goal was to
bootstrap a community of people interested in advocating and promoting Python.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this project failed in its primary goal ? relatively few
volunteers were found to contribute to the advocacy effort and no sustained
advocacy community appeared.</p>
<p>However, several important tasks were accomplished and these more than
justified the overall expense of the project:</p>
<p><strong>Targeted promotion of PyCon 2007</strong> led to a 50% increase in the number of
attendees at the conference, compared to 2006 (from 410 to 593 attendees). The
PSF earned an unexpected profit of $32.5K from PyCon 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Intensive effort on the Forrester Wave report on dynamic languages</strong> led
Forrester to conclude that among all the dynamic languages &quot;Python represents
the best combination of features, breadth of applicability, and strong
community.&quot; These reports are used by application development and management
professionals to make technology choices. For details see:

<p><strong>A number of high-quality screencasts about Python were developed.</strong> These are
designed to make it easier for new users to get started with Python. They can
be seen, along with videos contributed by other authors, at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.showmedo.com/videos/python">http://www.showmedo.com/videos/python</a></p>
<p>The lesson learned from this experiment is that, although many individual
advocates for Python exist, the Python community as a whole is not interested
or able to engage in organized advocacy. On the other hand, funding specific
projects aimed at promoting Python is a fruitful way for the PSF to approach
advocacy in the future and the PSF board is always open to new proposals in
this area.</p>

<h1>Become a Volunteer</h1>
<p>The exact total size of the Python user base is unknown, but even the known
user base utterly dwarfs the number of people that actively contribute to
Python itself, or to the community that surrounds it.</p>
<p>If you are not already working on Python or its website or contributing in
some other way, please consider getting involved! Python is open source, so it
is ? of course ? the community that makes it all work.</p>
<p>Helping out is fun, and it can be great for your career as well. Some of the
many options to consider are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Work on python.org:  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/pydotorg/website/">http://www.python.org/dev/pydotorg/website/</a></li>
<li>Work on updating and expanding the documentation for Python: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/doc/">http://www.python.org/doc/</a></li>
<li>Work on other infrastructure, such as the software behind <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/">http://us.pycon.org/</a> or the wiki at <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/">http://wiki.python.org/</a> or by helping with system administration</li>
<li>Become an advocate: Blog, write, talk, or screencast about Python, and show your friends what it can do. Casual peer recommendation is the number one most trusted source of information used in making technology choices.</li>
<li>Promote Python to your boss and encourage its use in internal projects. A company's use of Python in software testing, build scripting, and intranet applications is often followed by use of Python in its core products.</li>
<li>Support your local Python user group, or start a new group in your area: <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups">http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups</a></li>
<li>Attend or help out with your regional Python conference: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/community/workshops/">http://www.python.org/community/workshops/</a></li>
<li>Work on Python or its standard libraries: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/dev/">http://www.python.org/dev/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that software development is just one part of the overall picture, and
there is much that you can do without becoming an expert in programming
language design.</p>
<p>Regardless of how you get involved, the best way to get started is to find
some useful task or project where you can contribute. Take the initiative to
work on it (no need to ask for permission or instructions), announce it, and
you'll soon find yourself engaged and having fun as part of the world-wide
Python community.</p>

<h1>Make a Donation</h1>
<p>Even if you cannot get involved as a volunteer, please consider donating to
the PSF and Python financially in one or more of the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Donate to the PSF to help fund our activities: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/donations/">http://www.python.org/psf/donations/</a></li>
<li>Ask your company to sponsor PyCon. This is a great way to find employees that know Python, or to gain exposure for your company: <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2008/sponsors/">http://us.pycon.org/2008/sponsors/</a></li>
<li>If your company uses Python extensively, becoming a sponsor of the PSF helps protect that investment: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/">http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/</a></li>
</ul>
