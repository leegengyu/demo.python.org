in the State of Delaware and the name of the initial registered agent
of the corporation at such address are set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation. The corporation may, from time to time, designate a
different address as its registered office or a different person as
its registered agent, or both; provided, however, that such
designation shall become effective upon the filing of a statement of
such change with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as is
required by law.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2.2.  Other States.</strong> In the event the
corporation desires to
qualify to do business in one or more states other than Delaware, the

<h2>Meetings of Members</h2>
<p><strong>Section 3.1.  Place of Meetings.</strong>  Meetings of the
members shall be
held at the principal office of the corporation or any other place
(within or outside the State of Delaware and within or outside the
United States) designated in the notice of the meeting.
At the option of the Board of Directors, meetings may also be held
electronically or by teleconference as described in Section 13.8.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.2.  Annual Meeting.</strong> A meeting of the
members shall be held
annually at such time as the Board of Directors may determine (which
shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not more than
thirteen (13) months after the organization of the corporation and, in
the case of all other meetings, not more than fifteen (15) months
after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting
the members shall elect a Board of Directors and transact other proper
business.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.3.  Special Meetings.</strong> Special meetings
of the members shall
be held when directed by the Chairman, President or the Board of
Directors, or when requested in writing by not less than ten percent
(10%) of all members entitled to vote at the meeting.  The call for the
meeting shall be issued by the Secretary, unless the Chairman,
President, Board of Directors or members requesting the meeting shall
designate another person to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.4.  Notice.</strong> Written notice stating
the place, date and hour
of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less
than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting, at the
direction of the Chairman, President, the Secretary, or the officer or
persons calling the meeting, to each member of record entitled to vote
at such meeting. Notice may be
made as described in Section 13.7.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.5.  Notice of Adjourned Meetings.</strong> When a
meeting is
adjourned to another time or place, the corporation shall not be
required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If, however, the adjournment is for more than thirty
(30) days, or if after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a
new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given as provided in Section 3.4 above, to each
member of record on the new record date entitled to vote at such
meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.6.  Waiver of Notice.</strong>  Whenever notice
is required to be
given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of such
notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the members need be
specified in the written waiver of notice.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.7.  Fixing Record Date.</strong></p>
<p>(a) All members at 04:00 UTC on the day that notice of a meeting is
made are entitled to such notice. All members at 04:00 UTC on the day
that a meeting is held are entitled to vote at the meeting.</p>
<p>(b) If no prior action is required by the
General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware,
all members at 04:00 UTC on the day that an
action without meeting is taken shall be entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting. If prior action
by the Board of Directors is required by the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware,
those members at 04:00 UTC on the day that the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action
shall be entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting.</p>
<p>(c) The record date for determining members entitled to exercise any
rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
shall be at 04:00 UTC on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
thereto.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.8.  Record of Members Having Voting Rights.</strong>
The officer or
agent having charge of the membership records of the corporation shall
prepare and make available within five (5) days of
written request from any nominated member,
a complete list of the members entitled to vote at
the time the request is made. The list must be
in alphabetical order, showing the name,
email address and physical address of record of each member.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.9.  Member Quorum.</strong>  Except as otherwise
required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, one-third (1/3)
of the members entitled to vote, represented in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. When a
specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class of
members (if the members are divided into classes), one third (1/3) of
such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business
by that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless
the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. The directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes of the members present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors. Where a separate vote by class of members is
required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class
represented at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the
vote of a greater number is required by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.</p>
<p>After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of
members required for a quorum above the number of members present in
person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall
not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.10. Voting.</strong> Each nominated member shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting
of the members, except as may otherwise be provided in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Sponsor members that have appointed a representative, as described in
Section 4.3, are also entitled to one such vote.  Emeritus members are
not entitled to vote at members' meetings.</p>
<p>Members entitled to vote may vote either in person,
or by previously completed ballot if one has been provided,
or by proxy executed in writing by
the member or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.11. Proxies.</strong> Every member entitled to
vote at a meeting of
members or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or a member's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact, may authorize another person or persons to act for
him/her by proxy.</p>
<p>Every proxy must be signed by the member or his or her
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from
its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. All proxies shall be
revocable.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.12. Action by Members Without a Meeting.</strong>
Any action
required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of members of the corporation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent setting
forth the action so taken shall be signed by members having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that no written
consent shall be effective unless such consent (i) bears the date of
signature by each member signing such consent and (ii) is delivered to
the corporation within sixty (60) days of the date on which the
earliest consent was delivered to the corporation.  Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those members who have not
consented in writing.</p>

<h2>Members</h2>
<p><strong>Section 4.1. Member Classes.</strong> There are three
classes of members of the corporation, denoted as nominated members,
sponsor members, and emeritus members. References in these Bylaws to a
&quot;member&quot; or to the &quot;members&quot; of the corporation shall not include any
emeritus member or sponsor member unless explicitly provided otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.2. Nominated Members.</strong> To be eligible for
membership as a nominated member, a person or entity must be nominated
by a current nominated member of the corporation and must accept such
nomination by e-mail or in writing.  Nominated members have voting
rights in the corporation and are counted for the purposes of quorum
at members meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.3. Sponsor Members.</strong>
A sponsor member must pay a yearly fee to the corporation.  Sponsor
members may optionally appoint a representative to attend members
meetings by providing written notice of the appointment to the
corporation.  Only those sponsor members that have appointed a
representative have voting rights in the corporation and are included
in the membership count made for the purposes of quorum at members
meetings.</p>
<p>The initial
yearly fee is due upon admission to the corporation as a member on a
pro-rata basis for the remainder of the fiscal year. Thereafter, the
yearly fee is due upon the beginning of each fiscal year. From the due
date, until the fee is paid, all membership rights of the sponsor
member
are suspended until the sponsor member's yearly
fee has been paid in full.</p>
<p>The amount of the yearly fee shall be determined by the Board of
Directors by a simple majority vote.  The Directors may, if they
choose, define several different grades of sponsor member, each with a
different annual fee and receiving different benefits as determined by
the Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.4. Admission of Members.</strong>
A person or organization desiring membership must
complete a written membership application in such
form as shall be adopted by the Board of Directors from time to
time. The nomination,
if applicable, and the content of the membership application must be
included in a notice to the nominated members of the corporation at
least ten (10) days prior to any vote on the applicant's admission,
using a form of notice defined in Section 13.7. The initial members of the
corporation shall be admitted upon the affirmative vote of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation at the initial meeting of the Board of
Directors. Thereafter, members of the corporation shall be admitted as
members of the corporation only by a majority vote of the existing
members of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.5. Emeritus Members.</strong>
Nominated members may be voluntarily or involuntarily
converted to emeritus status.
Emeritus members have no voting rights and are not included in the
membership count for purposes of establishing a quorum.  Emeritus
members are entitled to attend (but not vote) at meetings of the
members.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.6. Voluntary Conversion of Membership to Emeritus
Status.</strong> Nominated members may convert their membership to emeritus status at any
time upon ten (10) days' written, signed notice delivered to an
officer of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.7. Involuntary Conversion of Membership to Emeritus
Status.</strong>
The membership of a nominated member may be converted into an emeritus
membership upon an affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the
members of the corporation who are present and eligible to vote at the
meeting, with the following restriction. Any vote for involuntary
conversion of membership to emeritus status must be held electronically
or by teleconference instead of in person, as described in Section 13.8.
The membership of a nominated member shall be converted into an emeritus
membership automatically upon failure of a nominated member to vote at
the last three (3) consecutive members' meetings and on any actions
without meeting that occurred since the first of these three meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.8. Reinstatement of Membership of Emeritus
Members.</strong> Upon
receipt of a written request and a new membership application from an
emeritus member, such
emeritus member shall be reinstated as a full member of the
corporation, and shall be entitled to exercise all rights as a nominated member
of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.9. Voluntary Withdrawal from Membership.</strong>
Members (including
emeritus members) may withdraw from membership in the corporation at
any time upon ten (10) days' written, signed notice delivered to an
officer of the corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.10. Termination of Membership.</strong>
A member's membership may be
terminated by an affirmative vote of a two-thirds majority of the
members of the corporation who are present and eligible to vote at the
meeting, with the following restriction. Any vote for termination of
membership must be held electronically or by teleconference instead of
in person, as described in Section 13.8. A sponsor member's membership
shall be automatically terminated if the sponsor member's yearly fee has
not been paid within three (3) months of the due date.</p>
<p><strong>Section 4.11. Effect of Withdrawal from or Termination of
Membership.</strong>  Upon
any withdrawal from or termination of the membership of any member, the
membership, including all related voting rights, of such member shall
be terminated. After a withdrawal or termination of the membership of
any member, such former member may reapply for membership in accordance
with Section 4.4 of these Bylaws.
If a sponsor member is involuntarily terminated from membership then
the sponsor member shall be returned a pro-rata portion of the yearly
fee based on the date of termination and the time remaining in the
fiscal year.</p>

provided in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.7.  Vacancies.</strong> Any vacancy occurring

Directors, including any vacancy created by reason of an increase in
the authorized number of directors, may be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the remaining directors though less than a
quorum of the Board of Directors or by a sole remaining director. If
there is more than one class of members entitled to nominate directors,
vacancies of directorships
elected by such class may be filled by a majority of the directors
elected by such class or by a sole remaining director. A director
elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office only until the next
election of directors by the members.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.8.  Quorum and Voting.</strong> A majority of
the number of
directors fixed in accordance with these Bylaws shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the
directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
the act of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.9.  Executive and Other Committees.</strong>
The Board of Directors,
by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board of Directors,
may designate an Executive Committee from among its members and such
other committees consisting of at least one director as determined by
the Board of Directors from time to time. Each committee, to the
extent provided in such authorizing resolution, shall have and may
exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation, as limited
by the laws of the State of Delaware.</p>
<p>Any member serving on an Executive Committee at the time of his or her
termination or conversion to emeritus status shall cease to be a
member of the committee. A member wishing to resign from an Executive
Committee may do so immediately upon written notice to the
Corporation. Such a member, upon resignation from the Executive
Committee, shall cease to be a member of the committee.</p>
<p>The Board may resolve to nominate a Director to serve as an alternate
to any committee member who is absent from a meeting of the committee
or who has ceased to be a member of the committee. The members of a
committee may, whether or not they constitute a quorum, unanimously
appoint a member of the Board of Directors to act in the place of a
member who is absent or who has ceased to be a member of the
committee.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.10. Place of Meetings.</strong> Regular and
special meetings of the
Board of Directors may be held within or outside the State of Delaware
and within or outside the United States.

electronically or by teleconference as described in Section 13.8.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.11. Time, Notice and Call of Meetings.</strong>
Regular meetings of
the Board of Directors shall be held within seven (7) days of the annual
meeting of members and at such times thereafter as the Board
of Directors may fix. No notice of regular directors' meetings shall
be required.</p>
<p>Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such
times as called by the Chairman of the Board, the President of the
corporation, or any two (2) directors. Written notice of the time and
place of special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be given to
each director as described in section 13.7
at least two (2) days before the meeting.  If notice
is sent by postal mail, it must be sent
at least fourteen (14) days before the meeting.</p>
<p>Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to
any director who signs a waiver of notice, either before or after the
meeting. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a
waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all objections
to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in
which it has been called or conveyed, except when a director states,
at the beginning of the meeting, any objection to the transaction of
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.</p>
<p>Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of
such Board or of any committee designated by such Board by conference
telephone, instant messaging, or similar communications medium by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other at the same
time.  Participating by such means shall constitute presence in person
at a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.12. Action Without a Meeting.</strong> Any action
required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the members of
the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in
writing or by e-mail, and such consent is filed with the minutes of the proceedings
of the board or committee. Such consent shall have the same effect as
a unanimous vote.</p>
<p><strong>Section 5.13. Director Conflicts of Interest.</strong>
No contract or other
transaction between the corporation and one or more of its directors
or between the corporation and any other corporation, partnership,
association or other organization in which one or more of the
directors of the corporation are directors or officers or are
financially interested, shall be void or voidable solely because of
such relationship or interest or solely because such director or
directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her or
their votes are counted for such purpose, if:</p>
<p>A. The material facts as to the director's relationship or interest
and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to
the Board of Directors or committee, and the Board of Directors or
committee in good faith authorizes, approves or ratifies the contract
or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be
less than a quorum; or</p>
<p>B. The material facts as to their relationship or interest and as to
the contract or transaction are disclosed or known to the members
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is
specifically approved in good faith by vote of such members; or</p>
<p>C. The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation at the
time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors,
a committee of the Board of Directors or the members.</p>
<p>Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof which authorizes, approves or ratifies such contract
or transaction.</p>

<h2>Indemnification of Officers and Directors</h2>
<p><strong>Section 12.1. Right to Indemnification.</strong>  Each person
who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or member of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter
permitted by applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not
be opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided,
however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.</strong>
Expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who is or was an
officer, director or member of the corporation, or who is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as an officer or director of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or
she is not entitled under applicable law to be indemnified by the
corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.</strong>
If a claim under this
Article is not paid in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days
after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation unless such action is based on the claimant having
committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct which make indemnification permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither
the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.4. Contract Rights.</strong> The provisions
of this Article shall
be a contract between the corporation and each director, officer or
member to which this Article applies.  No repeal or modification of
these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any right or obligation
with respect to any state of facts existing prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.5. Rights Non-exclusive.</strong> The
indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.6. Insurance.</strong> The corporation may
purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
member, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or of applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.7. Definitions.</strong> For purposes of
this Article, references
to &quot;the corporation&quot; shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of
a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued, and references to &quot;other enterprises&quot; shall
include employee benefit plans; references to &quot;fines&quot; shall include
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to &quot;serving at the request of the
corporation&quot; shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have
acted in a manner &quot;not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation&quot; as referred to in this Article.</p>
<p><strong>Section 12.8. Continued Coverage.</strong> The indemnification
and advancement
of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this Article shall,
unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or member and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
