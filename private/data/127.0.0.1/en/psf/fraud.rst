Statement about Suspicious Checks
=================================

The Python Software Foundation has been receiving calls from banks and
individuals that have received suspicious checks that are claimed to
have been issued by the Foundation.  These checks are usually related
to fraudulent grant schemes wherein the recipient is instructed to
cash the check and forward a portion of the funds, after which the
balance of the grant would be sent.

**The Python Software Foundation does not engage in or condone such
schemes.  Any checks related to such schemes are fraudulent and should
NOT be cashed or deposited.**

If you have any questions or wish to verify if a check is legitimate,
please email `psf@python.org <mailto:psf%40python.org>`_ with your telephone number and a director
or officer of the Foundation will call you back during business hours.
