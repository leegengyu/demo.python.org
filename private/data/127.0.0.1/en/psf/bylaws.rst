electronically or by teleconference as described in Section 13.8.

shall be, in the case of the first annual meeting, not more than
thirteen (13) months after the organization of the corporation and, in

after the date of the last annual meeting), at which annual meeting
the members shall elect a Board of Directors and transact other proper
business.

adjourned to another time or place, the corporation shall not be
required to give any notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place to which the meeting is adjourned are announced at the meeting
at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, any
business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the

(30) days, or if after the adjournment the Board of Directors fixes a
new record date for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given as provided in Section 3.4 above, to each
member of record on the new record date entitled to vote at such

**Section 3.6.  Waiver of Notice.**  Whenever notice
is required to be
given to any member, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person
or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be the equivalent to the giving of such
notice. Attendance by a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver
of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting
for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the members need be
specified in the written waiver of notice.

**Section 3.7.  Fixing Record Date.** 

(a) All members at 04:00 UTC on the day that notice of a meeting is

(b) If no prior action is required by the
General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware,
all members at 04:00 UTC on the day that an
action without meeting is taken shall be entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting. If prior action
by the Board of Directors is required by the General Corporation Law

Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action
shall be entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting.

rights, or for the purpose of any other lawful action,
shall be at 04:00 UTC on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating
thereto.

**Section 3.8.  Record of Members Having Voting Rights.**
The officer or
agent having charge of the membership records of the corporation shall
prepare and make available within five (5) days of

in alphabetical order, showing the name,
email address and physical address of record of each member.

**Section 3.9.  Member Quorum.**  Except as otherwise
required by law, by
the Certificate of Incorporation or by these Bylaws, one-third (1/3)
of the members entitled to vote, represented in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of members. When a
specified item of business is required to be voted on by a class of
members (if the members are divided into classes), one third (1/3) of
such class of members, represented in person or represented by proxy,
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such item of business
by that class of members. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote
of a majority of the members represented at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the members, unless
the vote of a greater number or voting by class is required by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or by the Certificate
of Incorporation or by these Bylaws. The directors shall be elected by
a plurality of the votes of the members present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the
election of directors. Where a separate vote by class of members is
required, the affirmative vote of a plurality of members of such class
represented at the meeting shall be the act of such class unless the
vote of a greater number is required by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware, the Certificate of Incorporation or these
Bylaws.

After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent withdrawal of members, so as to reduce the number of
members in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the
meeting below the number required for a quorum, shall not affect the
validity of any action taken at the meeting or any adjournment
thereof.

After a quorum has been established at a members' meeting, the
subsequent admission of new members, so as to increase the number of
members required for a quorum above the number of members present in
person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the meeting, shall
not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting or any
adjournment thereof.

**Section 3.10. Voting.** Each nominated member shall be
entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting
of the members, except as may otherwise be provided in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.
Sponsor members that have appointed a representative, as described in
Section 4.3, are also entitled to one such vote.  Emeritus members are
not entitled to vote at members' meetings.

Members entitled to vote may vote either in person,
or by previously completed ballot if one has been provided,
or by proxy executed in writing by
the member or his or her duly authorized attorney-in-fact.

**Section 3.11. Proxies.** Every member entitled to
vote at a meeting of
members or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or a member's duly authorized
attorney-in-fact, may authorize another person or persons to act for
him/her by proxy.

Every proxy must be signed by the member or his or her
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from
its date, unless otherwise provided in the proxy. All proxies shall be
revocable.

**Section 3.12. Action by Members Without a Meeting.**
Any action
required to be taken or which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of members of the corporation, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a written consent setting
forth the action so taken shall be signed by members having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize
or take such action at a meeting at which all members entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted; provided, however, that no written
consent shall be effective unless such consent (i) bears the date of
signature by each member signing such consent and (ii) is delivered to
the corporation within sixty (60) days of the date on which the
earliest consent was delivered to the corporation.  Prompt notice of
the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those members who have not
consented in writing.

shall be automatically terminated if the sponsor member's yearly fee has
not been paid within three (3) months of the due date.

**Section 4.11. Effect of Withdrawal from or Termination of
Membership.**  Upon
any withdrawal from or termination of the membership of any member, the
membership, including all related voting rights, of such member shall
be terminated. After a withdrawal or termination of the membership of
any member, such former member may reapply for membership in accordance
with Section 4.4 of these Bylaws.
If a sponsor member is involuntarily terminated from membership then

elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office only until the next
election of directors by the members.

The Board of Directors,
by resolution adopted by a majority of the full Board of Directors,

extent provided in such authorizing resolution, shall have and may
exercise all the power and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the corporation, as limited
by the laws of the State of Delaware.

Any member serving on an Executive Committee at the time of his or her
termination or conversion to emeritus status shall cease to be a
member of the committee. A member wishing to resign from an Executive
Committee may do so immediately upon written notice to the
Corporation. Such a member, upon resignation from the Executive
Committee, shall cease to be a member of the committee.

The Board may resolve to nominate a Director to serve as an alternate
to any committee member who is absent from a meeting of the committee
or who has ceased to be a member of the committee. The members of a

to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner in
which it has been called or conveyed, except when a director states,
at the beginning of the meeting, any objection to the transaction of
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

Members of the Board of Directors may participate in a meeting of
such Board or of any committee designated by such Board by conference
telephone, instant messaging, or similar communications medium by means of which all
persons participating in the meeting can communicate with each other at the same
time.  Participating by such means shall constitute presence in person
at a meeting.

required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of any
committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all the members of
the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in

directors are present at or participate in the meeting of the Board of
Directors or a committee thereof which authorizes, approves or
ratifies such contract or transaction or solely because his or her or
their votes are counted for such purpose, if:

Indemnification of Officers and Directors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Section 12.1. Right to Indemnification.**  Each person
who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending
or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, or investigative (other than an action by or in the
right of the corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or
was a director, officer or member of the corporation, or is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, or other enterprise, shall be entitled to indemnification
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement to the fullest extent now or hereafter
permitted by applicable law as long as such person acted in good faith
and in a manner that such person reasonably believed to be in or not
be opposed to the best interests of the corporation; provided,
however, that the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnity in connection with an action, suit or proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such action, suit or
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors.

**Section 12.2. Advance Payment of Expenses.**
Expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any person who is or was an
officer, director or member of the corporation, or who is or was
serving at the request of the corporation as an officer or director of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding, shall be paid by the
corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit
or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that he or
she is not entitled under applicable law to be indemnified by the
corporation.

**Section 12.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.**
If a claim under this
Article is not paid in full by the corporation within ninety (90) days
after a written claim has been received by the corporation, the
claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation
to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending any action or proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking has been tendered to the
corporation unless such action is based on the claimant having
committed an act involving moral turpitude) that the claimant has not
met the standards of conduct which make indemnification permissible
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the corporation. Neither
the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its members) that the claimant has not
met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

**Section 12.4. Contract Rights.** The provisions
of this Article shall
be a contract between the corporation and each director, officer or
member to which this Article applies.  No repeal or modification of
these Bylaws shall invalidate or detract from any right or obligation
with respect to any state of facts existing prior to the time of such
repeal or modification.

**Section 12.5. Rights Non-exclusive.** The
indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this
Article shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be
entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of members or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office.

**Section 12.6. Insurance.** The corporation may
purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
member, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any liability asserted against him or her and
incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or
her status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the
power to indemnify him or her against such liability under the
provisions of this Article or of applicable law.

**Section 12.7. Definitions.** For purposes of
this Article, references
to &quot;the corporation&quot; shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of
a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its
separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that
any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would
have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued, and references to &quot;other enterprises&quot; shall
include employee benefit plans; references to &quot;fines&quot; shall include
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee
benefit plan; and references to &quot;serving at the request of the
corporation&quot; shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or
involves services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants, or
beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have
acted in a manner &quot;not opposed to the best interests of the
corporation&quot; as referred to in this Article.

**Section 12.8. Continued Coverage.** The indemnification
and advancement
of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to this Article shall,
unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to
a person who has ceased to be a director, officer or member and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such person.
