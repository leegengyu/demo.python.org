Conversion to Emeritus PSF Membership
=====================================

The PSF needs active members.  Active members represent the Python
community and, at minimum, participate in the annual PSF members'
meetings.  If you are unable to participate actively, please consider
conversion to emeritus membership.

Inactive members make progress difficult for the PSF.  PSF members'
meetings require a quorum, a minimum number of members who attend in
person or vote by proxy/absentee ballot.  Some decisions require a
two-thirds majority vote of all members.  PSF members who are inactive
make achieving quorum less likely, and may make two-thirds majority
votes impossible.

To convert to emeritus status, please fill out the blanks below and
send a **signed** copy to the PSF.

The form may be sent by GPG/PGP-signed email to: 

    psf at python.org
