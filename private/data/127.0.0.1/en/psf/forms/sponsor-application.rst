Membership Application for Sponsor Member
=========================================

To be eligible for membership in the Python Software Foundation as a
nominated member, a person must be nominated by a current member of
the corporation.  A nominated member will be admitted upon receipt of
this completed application and a majority vote of the existing members
of the corporation.

A sponsor member is similar to a nominated member in all respects
except that a sponsor must pay a yearly fee to the corporation.  The
yearly fee is due upon the beginning of each fiscal year. From the due
date, until the fee is paid, all membership rights of the sponsor
member, including the right to vote and be counted for purposes of
quorum, are suspended and terminated until the sponsor member's yearly
fee has been paid in full.

The initial yearly fee is due upon admission to the corporation as
a member on a pro-rata basis for the remainder of the fiscal year.
The amount of the yearly fee may be changed from time to time by a
majority vote of the sponsor members of record at that time.  The
current sponsorship levels are described on the `sponsorship page <http://www.python.org/psf/sponsorship/>`_.

Membership terms start quarterly and are effective on the first day
of the quarter in which an application is accepted.  The sponsor fee
is pro-rated on a quarterly basis.  Example: A sponsor member joins on
May 1.  The membership is effective as of April 1, the start of the
second quarter.  The sponsorship fee for the year would be 3/4 of the
yearly fee.

A sponsor member must select an official representative to act on
its behalf at member meetings.  The official representative votes on
behalf of the sponsor member and may serve on the board of directors.
