IRS recognition of tax exempt status
------------------------------------

The PSF is a non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) corporation. 

- `Final determination letter from the IRS, May 5, 2006 </files/psf/records/determination_letter_05May06.pdf>`_ (960KB PDF scan)

- `Advanced ruling exemption letter, Feb. 25, 2003 </files/psf/records/tax-exempt.txt>`_ (OCR of original)

- `Form 872-C </files/psf/records/872c.jpg>`_ (470K scanned JPEG image)

The original copies of our tax exempt application, IRS form 1023, have
been lost by the PSF and the IRS.  Thus, we are not able to provide
copies of them.  The IRS sent us `this letter <exemption>`_ to explain.

Here are the answers to the essay questions of IRS Form 1023 that
we sent to the IRS when applying for 501(c)(3) public charity status,
in three formats:
`MS Word </files/psf/records/PSF1023.doc>`_,
`HTML </files/psf/records/PSF1023.html>`_,
`plain text </files/psf/records/PSF1023.txt>`_.  (The latter two formats were
generated by MS Word.)

IRS tax returns (990) open for public inspection
------------------------------------------------

Since the PSF is a public charity, we are required by the IRS to make our
records open to public inspection.  PDF files:

- `2006 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2006-redacted.pdf>`_

- `2005 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2005-redacted.pdf>`_

- `2004 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2004-redacted.pdf>`_

- `2003 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2003.pdf>`_

- `2002 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2002.pdf>`_ (not submitted to IRS since income was under $25,000)

- `2001 990 </files/psf/records/f990-2001.pdf>`_
