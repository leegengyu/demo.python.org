Dear Sir or Madam: 

This is in response to your request of April 1, 2004 regarding a copy
of your organization's exemption application.

We were unable to locate these documents. However, we can affirm
that your organization received exempt status in February 2003 and is
currently exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Because your organization will not be able to provide a copy of
its application on request, it should keep a copy of this letter in
its permanent records.

If your organization filed for exemption after July 15, 1987, or
had a copy of the application on July 15, 1987, it is required to make
available for public inspection a copy of its exemption application,
any supporting documents, and the exemption letter to any individual
who requests such documents in person or in writing. The law also
requires you to make your organization's annual return (if you are
required to file one) available for public inspection for three years
after the due date of the return. You can charge only a reasonable fee
for reproduction and actual postage costs for the copied
materials. The law does not require you to provide copies of public
inspection documents that are widely available, such as by posting
them on the Internet (World Wide Web).  You may be liable for a penalty
of $20 a day for each day you do not make these documents available
for public inspection (up to a maximum of $10,000 in the case of an
annual return).

Please accept our apology for the delay in responding to your request
and for any inconvenience this may have caused you or your
organization.

If you have any questions, please call us at the telephone number
shown in the heading of this letter.

Sincerely,

[signature]
