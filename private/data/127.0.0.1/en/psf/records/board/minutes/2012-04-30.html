<h1><a class="reference external" href="#id4">4   Treasurer Report</a></h1>
<p>The monthly Treasurer's Report was provided to Board members by K.
Kaiser prior to the Board meeting and produced from Quickbooks Online.</p>
<p>Here is an exerpt from the treasurer's report on a few of the activities
the treasurer has been focused on:</p>
<p>For the month of April 2012, the treasurer provided a sumation of the financial
activities by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our assets were up by 25K in March, reflecting the payments for PyCon
registration and sponsorship.  This was matched by a similar increase in
liability.</p>
<p>March was, of course, extremely busy financially, but the P&amp;L won't show
much change until we recognize the results of PyCon 2012.  At that point
(triggered by settling accounts with the convention center and the
hotels, including room commissions) the accrued expense and revenue will
move to the P&amp;L and our assets and liabilities will return to normal
levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reported on the revenue and expense below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revenue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the month of March, YTD income was down by 14K, primarily due to
payroll and Python Brochure expense. Total equity declined to 462K.</p>
<p>Donations for the month were $5026.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Expense:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>MISSING</strong></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The treasurer goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of March, AR was down to 245K due to PyCon 2012 Sponsor and
PSF Sponsor collection activity.  As of 16 April, AR was 168K.</p>
<p>I was involved in the purchase of a Dell server to host python.org, and
in modifying the domain's nameserver pointers to access a new dns host.
I'm also being asked to procure some additional server certificates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning the Honorary Associate Member Program (HAM), he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Associate Member program:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The website is available to accept Associate Member registrations.</p>
<p>I expect to get back to working on the comments received at PyCon.
This process will continue over the next few months.</p>
<p>We still need to link psfmember.org to python.org, improve the
attractiveness of the offering by adding content on python.org
relating to the Associate Membership, and make the community aware of
the opportunity.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Kurt concluded his report with a list of item the treasurer's office will
be focused on, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
My focus is on PyCon wrapup, AR/AP reduction, the Associate program, and
the increased activity and the strong interest in fiscal sponsorship
shown at PyCon.</blockquote>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="#id6">5.1   Communication Status</a></h2>
<p>B. Curtin, (new) Communications Officer, reported on continued activities
from last month. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Send announcement email about the blog to various mailing lists
(c.l.py, c.l.py.announce, etc.).</p>
<p>Brian is planning an email campaign with the Outreach &amp; Education
committee, and the PSF blog may be included in the resources
discussed there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brian also reported on the new activities for the month. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I (Brian) had a busier month than normal with other projects, so I was unable
to produce any new work outside of a post about the Indianapolis Python
Workshop. Tetsuya Morimoto completed a translation of the PyCon Language
Summit Report to Japanese, which was great to have such a large post
translated for that community.</p>
<p>I was contacted by a staffer from PHP Solutions magazine about contributing
some coverage of Python to be published, but no one on the team (or the ones
outside the team who I've contacted) has shown interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He reported the following information on the planned activities for next month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Via Steve Holden, we have some information to put together a story
about Python's use in schools from David Coopersmith along with a
student of his named Isaac. The same story involves some
praise for the trademark committee, which may or may not go into the
same post.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Community service award posts for Audrey Roy and Carl Trachte.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Post information about this summer's PyGames contest for students
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.summerpygames.org/">http://www.summerpygames.org/</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as the ongoing projects for the month are concerned, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Brian Curtin is working on a post about the video equipment purchased by the PSF and how it has been used to record conference talks and other events.</li>
<li>Recruiting other people to help write for the blog.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For tabled activities, B. Curtin said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyCon video equipment loan/rental program post      There was some discussion of offering the PyCon video equipment to PUGs for their meetings, but the mechanism to do it isn't in place, yet.</li>

<p>P. Campbell, Honorary Associate Membership (HAM) WebPages &amp; New Membership
Subscription Start-up Project (with K. Kaiser as the primary technical guru),
reported on the current issues or blockages the project may be faced with by
saying:</p>
<p>&quot;We are closer to the end of the technical phase of the Honorary Associate
Membership (HAM) Project.  However, attention is now being geared more
toward working on the HAM content cosmetics and beautification on the
python.org website.</p>
<p>Many technical hurdles have been jumped in order to setup the HAM program
and we are now beginning to see the finish line.&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the continued activities from last month are concerned, she reported:</p>
<p>Please see the message from Kurt Kaiser?s March 2012 treasurer?s report
regarding the activities involving the technical phase of the HAM program
implementation, website setup and membership signup:</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="#id8">5.3   Marketing Material</a></h2>
<p>M.A. Lemburg, Marketing Material Project Manager, provided a summary
of his work. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is lead by Marc-Andr? Lemburg who is in contact with
the people behind the Plone brochure created by the German Zope
User Group (DZUG): Jan Ulrich Hasecke and Armin Stro?-Radschinski.</p>
<p>We started working on the concept a few weeks after World Plone Day
in April 2010 and had several meetings and conference calls to take
the idea forward.</p>
<p>For more details, please see the brochure support site at:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more">http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more</a></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Marc-Andr? also reported on the progress of his project when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PyCon US teaser version of the brochure has so far not resulted
in much feedback from the PyCon US attendees. We've had a few
signups to the newsletter, a couple of visits to the site, but
that's about it.</p>
<p>Here's the link to the PDF of the teaser, in case you missed it:
<a class="reference external" href="http://brochure.getpython.info/media/flyer/python-brochure-pycon-us-2012-teaser-booklet/view">http://brochure.getpython.info/media/flyer/python-brochure-pycon-us-2012-teaser-booklet/view</a></p>
<p>It looks like finding sponsors will be just as much work as
getting the content lined up. We'll probably have to contact
potential sponsors directly and do one-on-one marketing.
We plan to do a call for sponsors via the usual channels
to help change the situation.</p>
<p>The online payment solution has been up since the start of
PyCon US in March. We do have a few ad and reference sponsor
signups, but no where near enough to start going to print.
Most of the signups are from Germany. If the US folks don't
hurry up, the reference list will be filled with German IT

<p>This works much like the subscription sponsorship where a company
can order extra brochure copies at very reasonable prices. The
difference is that companies can order extra copies for educational
institutions of their choice or of the PSF's choice. The bill will
be paid by the company and the boxes will go straight to the

<p>If the project goes well, we'll follow up with a second edition
of the brochure, Python flyers using material extracted from the
brochure, translated versions of the brochure and also consider
creating marketing material more targeted at specific user groups or
application fields.</p>
<p>In the long run, we'd also like to take the idea of producing
marketing material beyond printed material and develop booth
setups, giveaways, CDs, etc. to support conference organizers and
local user groups wishing to promote Python at their events.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Never really received a formal answer from PSF counsel about whether assignment of derived logos to the PSF might allow us to grant broader permission (for what would then, hypothetically) be PSF trademarks.</li>
<li>The &quot;PyLadies&quot; is considering granting the name to the PSF for stewardship. There are a number of inter-related issue with changes to the group that I have been discussing with them, so no motion about this is quite ready yet, but this is likely to be something the board will need to decide on.</li>
<li>Need to locate someone to create a better unified record of all the trademarks authorizations and refusals made by the committee. Perhaps this can be a responsibility of the PSF Secretary/Administrator in the near future? The information on actions is all there in mailing list archives, but not in any nicely digestible form (such as on a Wiki or a Google Docs spreadsheet).</li>
<li>Seemed to have missed Marc-Andre's motion to adopt the PSF logo from last month's meeting.  Added to agenda.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as reporting on new activities, however, he provided the following
list of items:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Apparently John Morrissey &lt;;jwm at horde.net&gt; displayed his authorized stained-glass versions of the Python logo at PyCon.  I did not personally have an opportunity to see them though.</li>
<li>A bunch of discussion with Fernando Perez and other IPython folks at PyCon about possible filing of an &quot;IPYTHON&quot; trademark by the PSF.  Since the mark would be derived from the PYTHON word mark, and yet the PSF itself has never used the derived mark, assuming the trademark by the PSF will presumably require fiscal sponsorship or some other arrangement between IPython and the PSF.  Mostly TBD.</li>
<li>Beginning of March: Permission for Steve Holden &lt;;steve at holdenweb.com&gt; to use the name &quot;Open Python&quot; and the Python logo embedded in a US map for several Open Bastion conferences.</li>
<li>Beginning of March: Discussion with Donald Stufft &lt;;donald at crate.io&gt; about derived version of Python logo for site <a class="reference external" href="https://crate.io">https://crate.io</a>.  An initial version of a derived logo was too much of a modification of the design, but some discussion led to a version that preserved the full shape of the Python logo (with some permitted perspective added, as if logo was stamped on side of a crate).</li>
<li>The kind Jonathan Hosmer &lt;;jon at pythonforios.com&gt; with whom we worked out the name &quot;Python for iOS&quot; for his Python distribution (modified from the confusing iPython, which is similar to the older IPython shell) decided to offer to PSF members complimentary licenses to his distribution which I distributed to some PSF members (including Guido).  FWIW, Jonathan offered more free copies than were claimed, but the recipients all seemed to like the distro.</li>
<li>Late March: Authorized use of logo on stickers made by Teemu Otala &lt;;info at nixstickers.com&gt;.</li>
<li>Late March: phillip torrone &lt;;pt at adafruit.com&gt; of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.adafruit.com">http://www.adafruit.com</a> provided some complimentary iron-on Python logo patches (that we authorized previously) to the PSF Secretary; and some more to the TC Chair.</li>
<li>Early April: Clarified for Amit Saha &lt;;amitsaha.in at gmail.com&gt; that use of screenshots of the Python shell in a Prentice-Hall book were not restrict by our trademarks or copyright policies.</li>
<li>Early April: Was notified by Lucius &lt;;lucius.bentley.kina at gmail.com&gt; that a second free-of-cost Python distribution for iOS is being sole on the iTunes store. The name is nominative, and no special action is needed by the PSF.  FWIW, the distribution seems to be of lower quality than Hosmer's &quot;Python for iOS&quot; but that is for buyers/users to decide.  Out of curtesy, I discussed this distribution with Mr. Hosmer, just so he would be aware of it.</li>
<li>Jonathan Hosmer requested, and I authorized, use of the somewhat more specific distribution names &quot;Python 2.7.2 for iOS&quot; and &quot;Python 3.2.3 for iOS&quot;.  My permission covered creation of any similar names that follow the numbering of underlying Python versions (he may create other versions than these--presumably at least later Python versions when they are created).</li>
<li>Late April: The PSF Secretary was able to send some complimentary &quot;Python 3&quot; stickers to Timothy Farrell &lt;;explorigin at gmail.com&gt; who requested them.</li>
<li>Late April: Authorized request from Ricardo B?nffy &lt;;rbanffy at gmail.com&gt; to use the Python logo with the words &quot;GruPy-SP&quot; for the S?o Paulo Python user group.  The modified logo preserves the icon, and uses a similar font to that used in our word mark version of the &quot;Python&quot; logo.</li>
