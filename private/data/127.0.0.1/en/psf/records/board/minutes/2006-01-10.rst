Action Items):

- Originally from September 2005, Section 4, Donor Levels: S. Deibel will add the topic of &quot;Donor Levels&quot; to the agenda of a future meeting, and may begin discussions via email before that.     Status: **carried forward**.

3.4   New in December
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following action items originated with the December 2005 meeting,
as highlighted in the minutes:

- Section 4, Python.org Redesign: S. Holden said he would speak with Tim Parkin and they would contact A. Kuchling about setting up a publicly-visible test server.     Status: **done**.  A. Kuchling reports that a publicly visible test server exists at `http://beta.python.org <http://beta.python.org>`_.  Committing changes to the SVN repository causes the beta.python.org site to be updated.

- Section 4, Python.org Redesign: S. Holden said that he would see if Tim Parkin is available for an IRC sprint.     Status: **done**.  D. Goodger reported that the IRC sprint happened, and work is ongoing.

- Section 4, Python.org Redesign: S. Holden said that he would be responsible for making sure that documentation is available for the new python.org system.     Status: **carried forward**.  S. Deibel reports that he has edited the docs based on his experiences and believes they are reasonable for someone to get up and running with the new pydotorg on Linux at least (psf.pollenation.net and pyramid.pollenation.net).

- Section 6, PSF Member Meeting: J. Hylton took on the task of finding someone to send out member meeting notices & proxy forms.     Status: **carried forward**.

- Section 6, PSF Member Meeting: M. von L?wis volunteered to ensure that the necessary steps are taken for the member meeting.     Status: **in progress**.  M. von L?wis reports that he created the various forms, and posted an email invitation.  We should set a deadline for closing the absentee ballot.

- Section 6, PSF Member Meeting: S. Deibel volunteered to send email to psf-members to ask people to do new member nominations.     Status: **done**.  See `PSF Members' Meeting <#psf-members-meeting>`_ below.

- Section 6, PSF Member Meeting: J. Hylton pledged to complete the minutes for the 2005 PSF member meeting.     Status: **carried forward**.

- Section 7, PSF BoF Sessions: A. Kuchling promised to write to Chris DiBona and Greg Stein and ask about their attendance at PyCon and possible BoF participation.     Status: **carried forward**.  A. Kuchling emailed DiBona & Stein about the Summer of Code panel; they replied, but the answer was basically &quot;ask again later&quot;.

- Section 7, PSF BoF Sessions: M. von L?wis agreed to see if the grant recipients (Greg Wilson, Brian Zimmer, and/or Ilya Etingof) will be at PyCon, and ask them to report on what they've done.     Status: **carried forward**.

4   Conference Committee
------------------------

A. Kuchling posted a status report to the PSF-board mailing list just
prior to the meeting:

    Current status of PyCon: 205 registrants.  The spreadsheet
    indicates that this means a loss of around $23K.  Break-even is
    calculated to be around 250 registrants.

    Jeff Rush did get the hotel to lower the food price from
    $42/person to $30; this is taken into account in the above figure.
    Another sponsor or two have appeared; they haven't been taken into
    account yet, but they won't change the picture very much.

    We aren't currently filling our room block, and therefore will be
    paying penalty fees on rooms and on food.

    (The penalty fee is just the cost of the rooms for that night.  We
    should therefore consider booking rooms for keynote speakers, PSF
    board members, etc.; if the PSF is paying the cost of X rooms, we
    might as well get something for the money.)

    Tutorial registrations are healthy: 136 seats have been filled (I
    don't know how many people that is, because people can register
    for 1 or 2 spots).  I estimate about $3000 profit from the
    tutorials at this time.

    Lengthening the early-bird brought in about 15 more registrations
    so far, so it didn't make a huge difference.  We'll raise prices
    on the 15th as planned.

    Current actions: more last-minute publicity.  I wrote an Advogato
    post, and submitted a slashdot story; will send out more
    announcements in hope of attracting more people; will send note to
    2005 attendees asking why they aren't attending (location, date,
    cost, program?); preparing some banner ads.  Jeff Rush will try to
    publicize more among local groups.

    Issue for discussion: should we tell the community about the
    shortfall?  Maybe people will rethink registering, or help
    publicize more.  Maybe it's too whiny.

    Issue for discussion: given that we've signed a 2-year contract,
    what do we do for 2007?  Options I can think of:

    - Try to be released from the contract.  This is only worth doing if it's free.  If we have to pay the $70000 penalty, it's better to give the conference and take the smaller 20K loss.

    - Reduce the contract numbers to ~200-250, so that the total costs are cheaper and we actually meet our numbers.

    - Keep the numbers the same, and try to do better on publicity to reduce the loss.  I made various mistakes -- most notably a delay in getting the schedule posted -- but it's not clear if that delay is responsible for the poor registration.

    Other suggestions?

S. Deibel asked A. Kuchling about the status of the funding we
approved for helping people to attend PyCon: &quot;Have you had any
responses to your posting?&quot;  A. Kuchling replied that five or six
requests for funding had been received.

N. Norwitz suggested that we need to publicize the Feb. 1 hotel
reservation deadline.  S. Deibel agreed, noting that in addition to
the lower room rate, &quot;We should make clear that reservations after Feb
1st don't count for us so making them before saves the PSF $89/nite or
whatever it is.&quot;

5   PSF Members' Meeting
------------------------

S. Deibel reported that he sent email asking for member and director
nominations and will follow up and keep the list of those nominated.
All directors present confirmed their candidacy for director; the
other two directors (Steve Holden and Jeremy Hylton) were to be
confirmed.  David Goodger and Brett Cannon had also been nominated for
director.

M. von L?wis asked about converting members into emeritus status,
noting that we don't have to do this (since it was done last year, it
isn't critical this year).  S. Deibel replied that Jeremy Hylton took
care of looking at records for emeritus conversion last year.  It was
agreed to forget about this.

S. Deibel expressed concern that the minutes from the 2005 members'
meeting were not in the repository.  D. Goodger noted that J. Hylton
has promised to produce the minutes, and there is a draft dated March
27 2005 in the PSF-Members mailing list archives.  M. von L?wis noted
that the attendance of previous years' meetings were also missing.
S. Deibel noted his general feeling that &quot;Jeremy continues to be too
busy to really carry out his job [secretary] in a timely
fashion...  And secretary is pretty darn important as we find out at
moments like this. ... We do need to fix the records issue, at least
going forward.&quot;

S. Deibel brought up deadlines.  M. von L?wis suggested January 30th
for sending out snail mail invitations to PSF members; S. Deibel
agreed.  A. Kuchling volunteered to help with mailing to
U.S. addresses.

S. Deibel also suggested January 30th as the deadline for the agenda
and nominations.  T. Peters noted that the bylaws state that for a
regular meeting, the notice is only required to state &quot;the place, date
and hour of the meeting&quot;.  M. von L?wis noted that all forms are sent
to the same address, and then distributed.  Absentees are requested to
also email the recipient, first confirming their presence.  Proxy
forms must be received one week in advance of the meeting.

6   Grants Committee
--------------------

M. von L?wis noted that Brian Zimmer did not complete the Jython
project, and we still need to determine what fraction was done and
what the payment should be.  Brian had suggested that Frank Wierzbicki
get the remaining money, since he is doing the remaining work.  M. von
L?wis asked if the board would agree to a procedure where Frank gets a
separate contract.  There was agreement in general, but discussion
ensued regarding the amount of the split, and how it was to be worded.

    RESOLVED, that the total amount previously authorized by the Board
    to be paid to Brian Zimmer as part of his Jython grant be split
    between Brian Zimmer and Frank Wierzbicki, in proportion to be
    decided by the Grants Committee.

Approved 5-0-0.

7   Adjournment

S. Deibel adjourned the meeting at 19:04 UTC.
