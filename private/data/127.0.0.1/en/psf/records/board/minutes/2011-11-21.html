<p>The monthly Treasurer's Report was provided to Board members by K.
Kaiser prior to the Board meeting and produced from Quickbooks Online.</p>
<p>Here is an exerpt from the treasurer's report on a few of the activities
the treasurer has been focused on:</p>
<p>&quot;YTD income was up by 57K in October due to Sponsor invoicing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AR is down by 7K due to PyCon 2012 Sponsor invoicing/collection
activity, offset by invoicing our PSF Sponsors.</p>
<p>Donations for the month were $817.</p>
<p><strong>MISSING</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We continued invoicing PyCon 2012 Sponsors and collecting receipts.
resulting in an 18K increase in Deferred Revenue.</p>
<p>Invoiced the rest of the PSF Sponsor Members for 2011, and continued
collection efforts on seven unpaid 2010 invoices.</p>
<p>Filed our annual PSF IRS Form 990 return.&quot;</p>
<p>Kurt concludes his report with a list of financial business items he will
be focused on, he said:</p>
<p>&quot;My focus is on the Associate Member program and AR reduction.  I'm also
looking into fiscal sponsorship issues and working with Python Boston.
We can do this - the question is how do we do it efficiently?&quot;</p>

<p>P. Campbell, Honorary Associate Membership (HAM) WebPages Start-up
Project, reported on the current issues or blockages the project may
be faced with by saying:</p>
<p>&quot;We have been in the technical phase of the Honorary Associate
Membership (HAM) Project for some time now. However, we are inches
away from recruiting our first PSF Honorary Associate member.</p>
<p>Many technical hurdles have been jumped in order to setup the HAM program
and we are now beginning to see some movement toward getting the HAM website
page prepared for membership recruitment and subscriptions. Yes, HAM members
will have their own webpage!&quot;</p>
<p>As far as the continued activities from last month are concerned, she reported:</p>
<p>&quot;Since Kurt Kaiser, our treasurer, has been able to devote more time to the
HAM project implementation and setup, we should be able to set the launch date
soon.</p>
<p>Please see the message from Kurt Kaiser?s November 2011 treasurer?s report
regarding the current status of the technical phase of the HAM program
implementation and maintenance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The text on HAM signup pages is preliminary and needs
improvement. I'm looking for help here!</p>
<p>Some advancement was made on the HAM project - particularly in how to
enforce user registration before collecting payment. However, the
effort on our annual tax filing and sponsor invoicing took most of my
available time this month.</p>
<p>Continuing work on a front page with Associate Member sign-up
information. Decide how to present the HAM Membership to the world,
probably via a python.org link.</p>

<p>A. Riley, Google Summer of Code (GSoC), reported on the program's new
activities for the month. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
I finished the PSF's payment request for GSoC 2011 and passed
the resulting purchase order to Kurt for invoicing.  As a change of policy
from previous years this must be invoiced by Dec 31 to receive payment.
The purchase order is for $15000 USD ($500 * 30 students mentored) in
addition to travel reimbursements for the GSoC mentor summit.</blockquote>
<p>Arc also reported on the planned activities for next month when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
Complete annual report for GSoC 2011 which I planned to deliver with my
report this month.</blockquote>
<p>As far as the ongoing projects, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google Code-In 2011</p>
<p>PSF was not accepted for Google Code-In 2011, the high school program run
over the Winter by the GSoC team at Google. The largest three organizations
which would operate under the PSF (MoinMoin, SymPy, and PySoy) were accepted
individually and there was insufficient interest from python-dev or smaller
Python projects to meet the requisite 40 example student tasks. Three
accepted Python organizations (out of 18 total) is an overall win for the
Python community. Smaller Python projects looking to get involved are welcome
to contact one of the other Python organizations to get their tasks included
in the December 16th task release.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="#id10">5.5   Marketing Material</a></h2>
<p>M.A.Lemburg, Marketing Material Project Manager, provided a summary
of his work. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is lead by Marc-Andr? Lemburg who is in contact with
the people behind the Plone brochure created by the German Zope
User Group (DZUG): Jan Ulrich Hasecke and Armin Stro?-Radschinski.</p>
<p>We started working on the concept a few weeks after World Plone Day
in April 2010 and had several meetings and conference calls to take
the idea forward.</p>
<p>For more details, please see the brochure support site at:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more">http://brochure.getpython.info/learn-more</a></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Marc-Andr? also reported on the progress of this project when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As in the past months, we've been trying hard to get content
collected from the contacts we've made.</p>
<p>In order to put more pressure on the contacts, we set a deadline
for content submission to this Friday, Nov. 18th, and ran another
round of emails by the contacts we'd most wanted content from.</p>
<p>We also ran an email campaign by the various press offices of
companies where we knew that getting management approval of
the case studies/success stories can be difficult. We're still
waiting for feedback from them.</p>
<p>Some of the larger companies we had contacted, already told us
that they won't make the deadline and so they'll have to wait
for the next edition of the brochure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Armin has been busy getting the credit card
acceptance setup for his production company Evenios, so that
he can accept credit card payments from the brochure sponsors.</p>
<p>Once that's complete, we'll start to contact companies about
possible ad sponsorships.</p>
<p>Our texter Jan Ulrich has already started working on putting
the various stories we did manage to collect together and will
continue with this work for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In December we'll then hopefully finalize the content and
get it ready for print in January.</p>
<p>These are the available sponsorship plans we have available:</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://brochure.getpython.info/sponsorship">http://brochure.getpython.info/sponsorship</a></blockquote>
<p>and here's the media data for the brochure:</p>

<p>Esp. the reference entry sponsorships should be interesting for
smaller Python companies:</p>

<p>M.A Lemberg reported on the current issues the project is faced with.

<p>Thanks !</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as future plans are concerned, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the project goes well, we'll follow up with a Python flyer,
translated versions of the brochure and also consider creating
marketing material more targeted at specific user groups or
application fields.</p>
<p>In the long run, we'd also like to take the idea of producing
marketing material beyond printed material and develop booth
setups, giveaways, CDs, etc. to support conference organizers and
local user groups wishing to promote Python at their events.</p>

<h2><a class="reference external" href="#id12">5.7   PyCon Chair</a></h2>
<p>J. Noller, PyCon Chair, provided us with information on when and where
the next two PyCon US conferences will be held, in addition to the web
location of the official PyCon 2012. Please see below:</p>
<p>PyCon 2012: March 7th ? 15th, Santa Clara, CA
PyCon 2013: March 11th ? 21st, Santa Clara, CA
Official Site: <a class="reference external" href="http://us.pycon.org/2012">http://us.pycon.org/2012</a></p>
<p>He also provided &quot;notes&quot; for this month. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are officially capping registration at 1500 attendees. The team feels that
this is beneficial to the conference as a whole, and allows us to maintain the
feel PyCon has grown into. We also feel this will encourage other regional
conferences to grow in turn.</p>
<p>I am working on a draft document to present to the board of directors that
clarifies PyCon's position as a key fundraising entity for the Foundation. As
the planning and execution of PyCon 2012 has continued, this has become more
and more true. More later; some thoughts here:

</blockquote>
<p>For the month of October, Jesse reported on &quot;Issues and blockages.&quot;
He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We are still waiting on AV/Recording vendor responses to our request for quotes. This is a concern - I'd like to lock these contracts down quickly, but can not make the bidding parties move more quickly. I have seen partial initial AV bids, but nothing concrete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as the continued activities from last month, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We continue to sign up sponsors at a healthy rate; we have several waiting corporate paperwork.</li>
<li>Financial updates will be sent to the private board list. We now have 69 sponsors.</li>
<li>Integration with CTE for registration has been completed by Eldarion. The registration component for PyCon 2012 is now in private testing and approval for a launch within the next 1-2 weeks.</li>
<li>Management of the program guide has been passed off to Yannick, Ewa, Van and Doug N. Idan Gazit has been tapped to do the artwork for the Program Guide and T-Shirts. Work on this progresses slowly.</li>
<li>Negotiations with Elegant Stitches are ongoing.</li>
<li>The Program Committee is going full steam - due to the sheer number of proposals and the amount of work required, they are missing the original delivery dates however, and are adjusting as best they can.</li>
<li>Tutorial selection/discussion is ongoing, and making excellent progress.</li>
<li>Negotiations between PyCon and O'Reilly and Pearson are complete.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesse also listed a new activity for the month. Please see below:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get solid quotes on t-shirt costs.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The last two PyCon US items reported on by Jesse were the &quot;planned for next
month&quot; where he listed six(6) items and included a list of the &quot;current Heads/Staff
for PyCon 2012.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
[see above]
1. Continue sponsor drive.
2. Continue to push hard to get the program committee work completed.
3. Work on wrapping up tutorials selection thanks to Stuart and team.
3. Once 2 and 3 are done, begin organizing the on-site and other volunteer
staff.
4. Get financial aid program up and active.
5. Get Startup row announced and launched (call for applications)
6. Wrap up plenary talk selection.</blockquote>

<p>Board Meeting Discussion:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Holden: &quot;PyCon 2012 sponsorship seems to continue to grow like a monster&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>J. Rush:  &quot;Longterm, with the wonderful increase in funding regarding sponsors,
what are we as a board going to do with the extra funds?&quot;</p>
<p>J. Noller: &quot;I plan on proposing to the board we continue on our path: outreach,
education, conference funding, etc. There's also the proposed revamp of python.org
and it's properties.&quot;</p>
<p>M.v L?wis: &quot;I think the PyCon sponsorship should be spent on PyCon.&quot;</p>
<p>S. Holden: &quot;I'd certainly suggest an increase in the sprints budget, and possibly
an increase in the maximum award. That seems to have got help to people writing
Python.&quot;</p>
<p>G. Willadsen: &quot;Can you afford captioning at some level? I know we talked about this,
but limited captioning, not for all talks, maybe is possible.&quot;</p>
<p>D. Napoleone: &quot;I have been pushing for Nuance to sponsor captioning for some time, but
a project which could have handled it at a more reasonable cost was cancelled.&quot;</p>
<p>J. Noller: &quot;Before anyone proposes we add another dime to the budget - myself included -
we need to have solid [PyCon 2012] registration and tutorial attendance numbers and to
fully close the books on this year.&quot;</p>

We had two sprints occur this month: The Plone Conference which was
organized months ago, and Open Hatch which was a last minute group.
Both events went well and we should be receiving some type of report
from both groups to publicize how their sprints went.</blockquote>
<p>As far as the continued activities from last month, he reported:</p>
<blockquote>
Reimbursement for PyCon Finland and the Boston Twisted sprint are
still needed. I will re-send the details to Kurt so we can get them
covered.</blockquote>
<p>On his report of the new activities for the month, J. Noller said:</p>
<blockquote>
The Plone Conference and Open Hatch sprints we sponsored this month
just sent in their reimbursement requests those will begin processing.</blockquote>
