Approved unanimously at the board meeting on August 13, 2002. 

    In order to 

    - Clarify the purpose of the PSF to current and potential members and donors, and to the general public;

    - Aid in soliciting donations, by affirming the charitable nature of the PSF's goals;

    - Help guide the Board in its deliberations;

    - Get a start on possible changes needed in the PSF's bylaws; and,

    - Justify further work on applying for public charity status,

    be it hereby 

    **RESOLVED**, that the PSF adopts the following mission statement. 

        The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a non-profit membership
        organization devoted to advancing open source technology related to the
        Python programming language.  It intends to qualify under the US
        Internal Revenue Code as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) scientific and
        educational public charity, and will conduct its business according to
        the rules for such organizations.

        By &quot;open source&quot; we mean freely available technology licensed under
        terms compatible with Version 1.9 (or later) of the Open Source
        Definition, as established by the Open Source Initiative (see
        `http://www.opensource.org/ <http://www.opensource.org/>`_).

        The PSF: 

        - Produces the core Python distribution, made available to the public free of charge.  This includes the Python language itself, its standard libraries and documentation, installers, source code, educational materials, and assorted tools and applications.

        - Establishes PSF licenses, ensuring the rights of the public to freely obtain, use, redistribute, and modify intellectual property held by the PSF.

        - Works with the Open Source Initiative to ensure that PSF licenses conform to the Open Source Definition.

        - Holds Python's intellectual property rights for releases 2.1 and following.

        - Seeks to obtain the intellectual property rights for Python releases prior to 2.1, for relicensing under the PSF Python license, to relieve the legal burden on Python's users.  The PSF may also seek rights to other Python-related software for relicensing under a PSF license.

        - Protects the Python name, and the names, service marks and trademarks associated with all other intellectual property held by the PSF.

        - Solicits and manages contributions to the Python codebase, and may perform these services on behalf of other open source Python-related codebases.

        - Raises funds to support PSF programs and services.  The regulations for public charity funding are complex.  Some consequences are that the vast bulk of funding must come from private contributions (including sponsoring memberships) and public grants, must come from a broad base, and that no single private donor can supply a substantial percentage of the PSF's total funding.  Additional revenue may be pursued in ways consistent with then-current rules for public charities and with Python's standing as an open source project. For example, the PSF may offer to sell conference proceedings, special Python distributions, or merchandise with distinctive insignia.

        - Publicizes, promotes the adoption of, and facilitates the ongoing development of Python-related technology and educational resources. This includes, but is not limited to, maintaining a public web site, planning Python conferences, and offering grants to Python-related open source projects.

        - Encourages and facilitates Python-related research in the public interest.
