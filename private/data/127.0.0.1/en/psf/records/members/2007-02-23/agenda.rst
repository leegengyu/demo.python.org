- Motion to Increase the Maximum Number of Directors      A call for nominations of PSF directors was issued, to the PSF-members list, to other lists, and to `the PSF blog <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/12/call-for-nominations-of-psf-directors.html>`_. We had a good response, with 4 new candidates stepping forward, in addition to the 8 incumbents.  We have a total of 12 candidates for Director this year, but currently the Board is limited to 8 Directors.  As Tim Peters put it, &quot;the bigger the board, the more gets done.&quot;     This motion aims to increase the limit on the number of Directors going forward.  We learned in the past that it's better to expand the Board than to miss out on offers of help.  This does *not* mean that all candidates for Director will automatically be elected; this year's Directors will be decided in the election below.     Therefore:          **WHEREAS** it is recognized that it is beneficial to the     Foundation to have a large number of active Directors, be it                         **RESOLVED**, that the PSF Board be increased to twelve (12)     Directors.

- Election of a New Board of Directors      A simple majority is required to elect each Director.  There are twelve candidates:   - David Turvene  - Andy Todd  - James Tauber  - Mark Summerfield  - Tim Peters *  - Martin von L?wis *  - Andrew Kuchling *  - Steve Holden *  - David Goodger *  - Stephan Deibel *  - Brett Cannon *  - David Ascher *    Incumbent Directors are marked with asterisks (&quot;*&quot;).  See the `candidates' summaries page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundation/BoardCandidates2007>`_.
