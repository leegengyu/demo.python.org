Motion to Increase the Maximum Number of Directors
--------------------------------------------------

A call for nominations of PSF directors was issued, to the
PSF-members, PSF-volunteers, and python-announce lists, and to the PSF
blog
(`http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/12/call-for-nominations-of-psf-directors.html <http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2006/12/call-for-nominations-of-psf-directors.html>`_).
We had a good response, with 4 new candidates stepping forward, in
addition to the 8 incumbents.  We have a total of 12 candidates for
Director this year, but currently the Board is limited to 8 Directors.
As Tim Peters put it, &quot;the bigger the board, the more gets done.&quot;

This motion aims to increase the limit on the number of Directors
going forward.  We learned in the past that it's better to expand the
Board than to miss out on offers of help.  This does *not* mean that
all candidates for Director will automatically be elected; this year's
Directors will be decided in the election below.

The motion: 

    **WHEREAS** it is recognized that it is beneficial to the
    Foundation to have a large number of active Directors, be it

    **RESOLVED**, that the PSF Board be increased to a maximum of
    twelve (12) Directors.

    **MISSING**
    **Please vote (check one)**
    [  ] For   [  ] Against   [  ] Abstain

To pass, the motion must receive more &quot;For&quot; votes than &quot;Against&quot;
votes.

Election of a New Board of Directors
------------------------------------

There are 12 candidates for a total of either 12 or 8 Director
positions, depending on the outcome of the vote on the motion above.
Since the outcome will not be known until the members' meeting, please
vote on both possibilities:

- 12 Director positions (if the motion above passes).  Vote &quot;Yes&quot; for a maximum of 12 candidates below in column &quot;A&quot;.

- 8 Director positions (if the motion above fails to pass).  Vote &quot;Yes&quot; for a maximum of 8 candidates below in column &quot;B&quot;.

To be elected, a nominee must receive more &quot;Yes&quot; votes than &quot;No&quot;
votes.

Please vote to accept as Director (check one of &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, or
&quot;Abstain&quot; for each nominee in each of columns &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;):

**MISSING**
****   **A: Check Max. 12 &quot;Yes&quot;**   **B: Check Max. 8 &quot;Yes&quot;**

**Nominee**   **Yes**   **No**   **Abstain**   **Yes**   **No**   **Abstain**
