Policies for PSF Weblog
=======================

**Version 1.03** 

Accepted by the PSF Board, March 13 2006. 

This policy applies to `the PSF weblog <http://pyfound.blogspot.com>`_. 

Access Policies
---------------

- Officers will always have posting privileges for the weblog. Therefore, officers can always post items without requiring permission from anyone else.  This access is removed when the person is no longer an officer.

- The Board will appoint a weblog editor, who will also have posting access.

- PSF members and PSF committees can submit items for posting to the weblog editor, who can accept or deny them subject to Board override.  The editor may modify entries before posting them.

- The editor serves at the pleasure of the Board, who may dismiss or replace the editor at any time following a resolution to do so.

Editorial Policies
------------------

- The weblog is intended for publicizing PSF-related news. Possible news items include, but are not limited to:- Announcements of PSF events at conferences  - Status reports from committees (e.g. grant selection news, PyCon status updates)  - Calls for PSF volunteers for a new task.  - The availability of new board minutes, once they've been accepted.

- The weblog is *not* for general Python-related news.  The editor may post new releases of PSF-owned software (e.g. Python itself), but will usually not post items about arbitrary third-party Python software and may decline such submissions.

- Because the PSF is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit education organization, weblog entries must not take positions on political topics.  For example, the PSF cannot post links to campaigns for or against legislation or political candidates.  Directors, officers and members should post such material on their own weblogs.
