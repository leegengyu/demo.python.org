The Python Software Foundation is seeking grant proposals for projects

technology, and educational resources. The PSF plans to issue calls
for proposals regularly.

Proposals should be for specific projects with a clear objective,
rather than support for ongoing activities. Proposals should be brief
(a few pages of text), and they should explain:

- what the objective of the project is,

- what precisely the funds are needed for,

- a delivery plan, indicating what deliverables will be provided at what time, and

- a payment plan, indicating what payments should be made at what time.

Awarded grants can range up to $40,000. 

Proposals for this call must be submitted before October 1, 2004.
Projects will start on November 1, 2004, and must be completed by
October 30, 2005.

The above rules were accepted by the PSF board July 7, 2004 via email
