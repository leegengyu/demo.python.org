<h2>Python 2.1.3 Release Notes</h2>
<p>Release date: 08-April-2002</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1-3-final">
<h2>What's new in Python 2.1.3 (final)?</h2>
<p>Core</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed two bugs reported as SF #535905: under certain conditions,
deallocating a deeply nested structure could cause a segfault in the
garbage collector, due to interaction with the &quot;trashcan&quot; code;
access to the current frame during destruction of a local variable
could access a pointer to freed memory.</li>
<li>SF #457466: popenx() argument mangling hangs python (win9x only).
Under certain circumstances, using any of the popen calls on win9x
would cause python to hang.</li>
</ul>
<p>Library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The xml.sax.expatreader.ExpatParser class will no longer create
circular references by using itself as the locator that gets passed
to the content handler implementation.  [SF bug #535474]</li>
<li>A security hole (&quot;double free&quot;) was found in zlib-1.1.3, a popular
third party compression library used by some Python modules.  The
hole was quickly plugged in zlib-1.1.4, and the Windows build of
Python now ships with zlib-1.1.4.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The installer now installs Start menu shortcuts under (the local
equivalent of) &quot;All Users&quot; when doing an Admin install.</li>
<li>If you do what it takes to compile SSL support for Windows, a bug in
httplib.py prevented SSL from working correctly.  That bug has been
fixed, but note that SSL support on Windows is still not enabled in
this release.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1-2-final">
<h2>What's New in Python 2.1.2 (final)?</h2>
<p>Changes in metadata:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed the version numbers in the LICENSE, and the copyright date in
numerous places.</li>
<li>Fixed the instructions (in Doc/lib/libposix.tex) for building with
Large Filesystem Support (LFS).</li>
<li>Added GetArgv() docs in Mac UI chapter.</li>
<li>Some fixes to the Misc/NEWS file (e.g. the note about the new 32-bit
installer wasn't in the 2.1.2c1 release).</li>
</ul>
<p>One code change:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Backported a bugfix for importdl.c, SF patch #471839: Bug when
extensions import extensions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1-2-rc1">
<h2>What's New in Python 2.1.2 (rc1)?</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The 32-bit Windows installer (new for 2.2) is now used for 2.1.2
too.  This works much better on Windows 2000 and XP, especially
if you don't have Administrator privileges.</li>
<li>The socket object gained a new method, 'sendall()'. This method
is guaranteed to send all data - this is not guaranteed by the
'send()' method. See also SF patch #474307. The standard library
has been updated to use this method where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many bugs were fixed. The following is a list of some of the major or
notable fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix for incorrectly swapped arguments to PyFrame_BlockSetup in ceval.c.
This bug could cause python to crash. It was related to using a 'continue'
inside a 'try' block.</li>
<li>SF bug #422004: Py_Initialise fix that allows reload(exceptions) to
work - this is apparently very important for embedded python working
with multiple interpreters.</li>
<li>SF patch #500401: webbrowser: tightened up the command passed to
os.system() so that arbitrary shell code can't be executed because a
bogus URL was passed in.</li>
<li>The Python compiler package was updated to correctly calculate stack
depth in some cases. This was affecting Zope Python Scripts rather badly.</li>
<li>Largefile support was added (but not on by default, you'll need to follow
the instructions in the documentation of the posix module).</li>
<li>SF bug #443120: Fix a cgi.py denial-of-service attack,</li>
<li>socketmodule's SSL_read and SSL_write now release the global interpreter
lock.</li>
<li>threading uses the PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM attribute where available.
This should remove the need to add tiny sleeps at the start of threads
to allow other threads to be scheduled.</li>
<li>Lib/asyncore is now more defensive in select()</li>
<li>Lib/dumbdbm is now merely dumb, rather than terminally broken.</li>
<li>SF bug #441712: more liberal handling of ftp servers' 227 responses
(don't require parentheses).</li>
<li>SF bug #440693: make sure zip files use &quot;/&quot; as directory separator.</li>
<li>If 'unittest.py' was run from the command line with the name of a test
case class as a parameter, it failed with an ugly error.</li>
<li>SF bug #231249: cgi.py opens too many (temporary) files.</li>
<li>Lib/CGIHTTPServer.py supports binary data on Windows.</li>
<li>base64.encodestring/decodestring are much faster.</li>
<li>SF bug #471928: global made w/nested list comprehensions</li>
<li>SF patch #422106: fix segmentation fault in sys.displayhook</li>
<li>SF bug 476129: gc.collect sometimes hangs</li>
<li>SF bug #448351: select.select() puts FDs on the heap where needed.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1-final">
<h2>What's New in Python 2.1 (final)?</h2>
<p>We only changed a few things since the last release candidate, all in
Python library code:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A bug in the locale module was fixed that affected locales which
define no grouping for numeric formatting.</li>
<li>A few bugs in the weakref module's implementations of weak
dictionaries (WeakValueDictionary and WeakKeyDictionary) were fixed,
and the test suite was updated to check for these bugs.</li>
<li>An old bug in the os.path.walk() function (introduced in Python
2.0!) was fixed: a non-existent file would cause an exception
instead of being ignored.</li>
<li>Fixed a few bugs in the new symtable module found by Neil Norwitz's
PyChecker.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1c2">
<h2>What's New in Python 2.1c2?</h2>
<p>A flurry of small changes, and one showstopper fixed in the nick of
time made it necessary to release another release candidate.  The list
here is the <em>complete</em> list of patches (except version updates):</p>
<p>Core</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tim discovered a nasty bug in the dictionary code, caused by
PyDict_Next() calling dict_resize(), and the GC code's use of
PyDict_Next() violating an assumption in dict_items().  This was
fixed with considerable amounts of band-aid, but the net effect is a
saner and more robust implementation.</li>
<li>Made a bunch of symbols static that were accidentally global.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build and Ports</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The setup.py script didn't check for a new enough version of zlib
(1.1.3 is needed).  Now it does.</li>
<li>Changed &quot;make clean&quot; target to also remove shared libraries.</li>
<li>Added a more general warning about the SGI Irix optimizer to README.</li>
</ul>
<p>Library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix a bug in urllib.basejoin(&quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://host">http://host</a>&quot;, &quot;../file.html&quot;) which
omitted the slash between host and file.html.</li>
<li>The mailbox module's _Mailbox class contained a completely broken
and undocumented seek() method.  Ripped it out.</li>
<li>Fixed a bunch of typos in various library modules (urllib2, smtpd,
sgmllib, netrc, chunk) found by Neil Norwitz's PyChecker.</li>
<li>Fixed a few last-minute bugs in unittest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Reverted the patch to the OpenSSL code in socketmodule.c to support
RAND_status() and the EGD, and the subsequent patch that tried to
fix it for pre-0.9.5 versions; the problem with the patch is that on
some systems it issues a warning whenever socket is imported, and
that's unacceptable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed the pickle tests to work with &quot;import test.test_pickle&quot;.</li>
<li>Tweaked test_locale.py to actually run the test Windows.</li>
<li>In distutils/archive_util.py, call zipfile.ZipFile() with mode &quot;w&quot;,
not &quot;wb&quot; (which is not a valid mode at all).</li>
<li>Fix pstats browser crashes.  Import readline if it exists to make
the user interface nicer.</li>
<li>Add &quot;import thread&quot; to the top of test modules that import the
threading module (test_asynchat and test_threadedtempfile).  This
prevents test failures caused by a broken threading module resulting
from a previously caught failed import.</li>
<li>Changed test_asynchat.py to set the SO_REUSEADDR option; this was
needed on some platforms (e.g. Solaris 8) when the tests are run
twice in succession.</li>
<li>Skip rather than fail test_sunaudiodev if no audio device is found.</li>

<p>Library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The TERMIOS and SOCKET modules are now truly obsolete and
unnecessary.  Their symbols are incorporated in the termios and
socket modules.</li>
<li>Fixed some 64-bit bugs in pickle, cPickle, and struct, and added
better tests for pickling.</li>
<li>threading: make Condition.wait() robust against KeyboardInterrupt.</li>
<li>zipfile: add support to zipfile to support opening an archive
represented by an open file rather than a file name.  Fix bug where
the archive was not properly closed.  Fixed a bug in this bugfix
where flush() was called for a read-only file.</li>
<li>imputil: added an uninstall() method to the ImportManager.</li>
<li>Canvas: fixed bugs in lower() and tkraise() methods.</li>
<li>SocketServer: API change (added overridable close_request() method)
so that the TCP server can explicitly close the request.</li>
<li>pstats: Eric Raymond added a simple interactive statistics browser,
invoked when the module is run as a script.</li>
<li>locale: fixed a problem in format().</li>

4.2, without breaking for earlier versions.</li>
<li>Hopefully fixed a buffering problem in linuxaudiodev.</li>
<li>Attempted a fix to make the OpenSSL support in the socket module
work again with pre-0.9.5 versions of OpenSSL.</li>

in the rest of the pydoc code, and added some features to his
inspect module.</li>
<li>An updated python-mode.el version 4.1 which integrates Ken
Manheimer's pdbtrack.el.  This makes debugging Python code via pdb
much nicer in XEmacs and Emacs.  When stepping through your program
with pdb, in either the shell window or the <em>Python</em> window, the
source file and line will be tracked by an arrow.  Very cool!</li>

<h2>What's New in Python 2.1 beta 2?</h2>
<p>(Unlisted are many fixed bugs, more documentation, etc.)</p>
<p>Core language, builtins, and interpreter</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The nested scopes work (enabled by &quot;from __future__ import
nested_scopes&quot;) is completed; in particular, the future now extends
into code executed through exec, eval() and execfile(), and into the
interactive interpreter.</li>
<li>When calling a base class method (e.g. BaseClass.__init__(self)),
this is now allowed even if self is not strictly spoken a class
instance (e.g. when using metaclasses or the Don Beaudry hook).</li>
<li>Slice objects are now comparable but not hashable; this prevents
dict[:] from being accepted but meaningless.</li>
<li>Complex division is now calculated using less braindead algorithms.
This doesn't change semantics except it's more likely to give useful
results in extreme cases.  Complex repr() now uses full precision
like float repr().</li>
<li>sgmllib.py now calls handle_decl() for simple &lt;!...&gt; declarations.</li>
<li>It is illegal to assign to the name __debug__, which is set when the
interpreter starts.  It is effectively a compile-time constant.</li>
<li>A warning will be issued if a global statement for a variable
follows a use or assignment of that variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>unittest.py, a unit testing framework by Steve Purcell (PyUNIT,
inspired by JUnit), is now part of the standard library.  You now
have a choice of two testing frameworks: unittest requires you to
write testcases as separate code, doctest gathers them from
docstrings.  Both approaches have their advantages and
disadvantages.</li>
<li>A new module Tix was added, which wraps the Tix extension library
for Tk.  With that module, it is not necessary to statically link
Tix with _tkinter, since Tix will be loaded with Tcl's &quot;package
require&quot; command.  See Demo/tix/.</li>
<li>tzparse.py is now obsolete.</li>
<li>In gzip.py, the seek() and tell() methods are removed -- they were
non-functional anyway, and it's better if callers can test for their
existence with hasattr().</li>
</ul>
<p>Python/C API</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>PyDict_Next(): it is now safe to call PyDict_SetItem() with a key
that's already in the dictionary during a PyDict_Next() iteration.
This used to fail occasionally when a dictionary resize operation
could be triggered that would rehash all the keys.  All other
modifications to the dictionary are still off-limits during a
PyDict_Next() iteration!</li>
<li>New extended APIs related to passing compiler variables around.</li>
<li>New abstract APIs PyObject_IsInstance(), PyObject_IsSubclass()
implement isinstance() and issubclass().</li>
<li>Py_BuildValue() now has a &quot;D&quot; conversion to create a Python complex
number from a Py_complex C value.</li>
<li>Extensions types which support weak references must now set the
field allocated for the weak reference machinery to NULL themselves;
this is done to avoid the cost of checking each object for having a
weakly referencable type in PyObject_INIT(), since most types are
not weakly referencable.</li>
<li>PyFrame_FastToLocals() and PyFrame_LocalsToFast() copy bindings for
free variables and cell variables to and from the frame's f_locals.</li>
<li>Variants of several functions defined in pythonrun.h have been added
to support the nested_scopes future statement.  The variants all end
in Flags and take an extra argument, a PyCompilerFlags *; examples:
PyRun_AnyFileExFlags(), PyRun_InteractiveLoopFlags().  These
variants may be removed in Python 2.2, when nested scopes are
mandatory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distutils</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the sdist command now writes a PKG-INFO file, as described in PEP 241,
into the release tree.</li>
<li>several enhancements to the bdist_wininst command from Thomas Heller
(an uninstaller, more customization of the installer's display)</li>
<li>from Jack Jansen: added Mac-specific code to generate a dialog for
users to specify the command-line (because providing a command-line with
MacPython is awkward).  Jack also made various fixes for the Mac
and the Metrowerks compiler.</li>
<li>added 'platforms' and 'keywords' to the set of metadata that can be
specified for a distribution.</li>
<li>applied patches from Jason Tishler to make the compiler class work with
Cygwin.</li>

<div class="section" id="what-s-new-in-python-2-1-beta-1">
<h2>What's New in Python 2.1 beta 1?</h2>
<p>Core language, builtins, and interpreter</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Following an outcry from the community about the amount of code
broken by the nested scopes feature introduced in 2.1a2, we decided
to make this feature optional, and to wait until Python 2.2 (or at
least 6 months) to make it standard.  The option can be enabled on a
per-module basis by adding &quot;from __future__ import nested_scopes&quot; at
the beginning of a module (before any other statements, but after
comments and an optional docstring).  See PEP 236 (Back to the
__future__) for a description of the __future__ statement.  PEP 227
(Statically Nested Scopes) has been updated to reflect this change,
and to clarify the semantics in a number of endcases.</li>
<li>The nested scopes code, when enabled, has been hardened, and most
bugs and memory leaks in it have been fixed.</li>
<li>Compile-time warnings are now generated for a number of conditions
that will break or change in meaning when nested scopes are enabled:<ul>
<li>Using &quot;from...import *&quot; or &quot;exec&quot; without in-clause in a function
scope that also defines a lambda or nested function with one or
more free (non-local) variables.  The presence of the import* or
bare exec makes it impossible for the compiler to determine the
exact set of local variables in the outer scope, which makes it
impossible to determine the bindings for free variables in the
inner scope.  To avoid the warning about import *, change it into
an import of explicitly name object, or move the import* statement
to the global scope; to avoid the warning about bare exec, use
exec...in... (a good idea anyway -- there's a possibility that
bare exec will be deprecated in the future).</li>
<li>Use of a global variable in a nested scope with the same name as a
local variable in a surrounding scope.  This will change in
meaning with nested scopes: the name in the inner scope will
reference the variable in the outer scope rather than the global
of the same name.  To avoid the warning, either rename the outer
variable, or use a global statement in the inner function.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An optional object allocator has been included.  This allocator is
optimized for Python objects and should be faster and use less memory
than the standard system allocator.  It is not enabled by default
because of possible thread safety problems.  The allocator is only
protected by the Python interpreter lock and it is possible that some
extension modules require a thread safe allocator.  The object
allocator can be enabled by providing the &quot;--with-pymalloc&quot; option to
configure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>pyexpat now detects the expat version if expat.h defines it. A
number of additional handlers are provided, which are only available
since expat 1.95. In addition, the methods SetParamEntityParsing and
GetInputContext of Parser objects are available with 1.95.x
only. Parser objects now provide the ordered_attributes and
specified_attributes attributes. A new module expat.model was added,
which offers a number of additional constants if 1.95.x is used.</li>
<li>xml.dom offers the new functions registerDOMImplementation and
getDOMImplementation.</li>
<li>xml.dom.minidom offers a toprettyxml method. A number of DOM
conformance issues have been resolved. In particular, Element now
has an hasAttributes method, and the handling of namespaces was
improved.</li>
<li>Ka-Ping Yee contributed two new modules: inspect.py, a module for
getting information about live Python code, and pydoc.py, a module
for interactively converting docstrings to HTML or text.
Tools/scripts/pydoc, which is now automatically installed into
&lt;prefix&gt;/bin, uses pydoc.py to display documentation; try running
&quot;pydoc -h&quot; for instructions.  &quot;pydoc -g&quot; pops up a small GUI that
lets you browse the module docstrings using a web browser.</li>
<li>New library module difflib.py, primarily packaging the SequenceMatcher
class at the heart of the popular ndiff.py file-comparison tool.</li>
<li>doctest.py (a framework for verifying Python code examples in docstrings)
is now part of the std library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows changes</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A new entry in the Start menu, &quot;Module Docs&quot;, runs &quot;pydoc -g&quot; -- a
small GUI that lets you browse the module docstrings using your
default web browser.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Import is now case-sensitive.  PEP 235 (Import on Case-Insensitive
Platforms) is implemented.  See</p>

<p>for full details, especially the &quot;Current Lower-Left Semantics&quot; section.
The new Windows import rules are simpler than before:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li>If the PYTHONCASEOK environment variable exists, same as
before:  silently accept the first case-insensitive match of any
kind; raise ImportError if none found.</li>
<li>Else search sys.path for the first case-sensitive match; raise
ImportError if none found.</li>
</ol>
<p>The same rules have been implented on other platforms with case-
insensitive but case-preserving filesystems too (including Cygwin, and
several flavors of Macintosh operating systems).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">winsound module:  Under Win9x, winsound.Beep() now attempts to simulate
what it's supposed to do (and does do under NT and 2000) via direct
port manipulation.  It's unknown whether this will work on all systems,
but it does work on my Win98SE systems now and was known to be useless on
all Win9x systems before.</p>

<li><p class="first">Build:  Subproject _test (effectively) renamed to _testcapi.</p>

<p>New platforms</p>

<li>2.1 should compile and run out of the box under MacOS X, even using HFS+.
Thanks to Steven Majewski!</li>
<li>2.1 should compile and run out of the box on Cygwin.  Thanks to Jason
Tishler!</li>
<li>2.1 contains new files and patches for RISCOS, thanks to Dietmar
Schwertberger!  See RISCOS/README for more information -- it seems
that because of the bizarre filename conventions on RISCOS, no port
to that platform is easy.  Note that the new variable os.endsep is
silently supported in order to make life easier on this platform,
but we don't advertise it because it's not worth for most folks to
care about RISCOS portability.</li>

<h2>What's New in Python 2.1 alpha 2?</h2>
<p>Core language, builtins, and interpreter</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Scopes nest.  If a name is used in a function or class, but is not
local, the definition in the nearest enclosing function scope will
be used.  One consequence of this change is that lambda statements
could reference variables in the namespaces where the lambda is
defined.  In some unusual cases, this change will break code.</p>
<p>In all previous version of Python, names were resolved in exactly
three namespaces -- the local namespace, the global namespace, and
the builtin namespace.  According to this old definition, if a
function A is defined within a function B, the names bound in B are
not visible in A.  The new rules make names bound in B visible in A,
unless A contains a name binding that hides the binding in B.</p>
<p>Section 4.1 of the reference manual describes the new scoping rules
in detail.  The test script in Lib/test/test_scope.py demonstrates
some of the effects of the change.</p>
<p>The new rules will cause existing code to break if it defines nested
functions where an outer function has local variables with the same
name as globals or builtins used by the inner function.  Example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def munge(str):
    def helper(x):
        return str(x)
    if type(str) != type(''):
        str = helper(str)
    return str.strip()
</pre>
<p>Under the old rules, the name str in helper() is bound to the
builtin function str().  Under the new rules, it will be bound to
the argument named str and an error will occur when helper() is
called.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The compiler will report a SyntaxError if &quot;from ... import *&quot; occurs
in a function or class scope.  The language reference has documented
that this case is illegal, but the compiler never checked for it.
The recent introduction of nested scope makes the meaning of this
form of name binding ambiguous.  In a future release, the compiler
may allow this form when there is no possibility of ambiguity.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">repr(string) is easier to read, now using hex escapes instead of octal,
and using t, n and r instead of 011, 012 and 015 (respectively):</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;\texample \r\n&quot; + chr(0) + chr(255)
'\texample \r\n\x00\xff'         # in 2.1
'\011example \015\012\000\377'   # in 2.0
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Functions are now compared and hashed by identity, not by value, since
the func_code attribute is writable.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Weak references (PEP 205) have been added.  This involves a few
changes in the core, an extension module (_weakref), and a Python
module (weakref).  The weakref module is the public interface.  It
includes support for &quot;explicit&quot; weak references, proxy objects, and
mappings with weakly held values.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A 'continue' statement can now appear in a try block within the body
of a loop.  It is still not possible to use continue in a finally
clause.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard library</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>mailbox.py now has a new class, PortableUnixMailbox which is
identical to UnixMailbox but uses a more portable scheme for
determining From_ separators.  Also, the constructors for all the
classes in this module have a new optional 'factory' argument, which
is a callable used when new message classes must be instantiated by
the next() method.</li>
<li>random.py is now self-contained, and offers all the functionality of
the now-deprecated whrandom.py.  See the docs for details.  random.py
also supports new functions getstate() and setstate(), for saving
and restoring the internal state of the generator; and jumpahead(n),
for quickly forcing the internal state to be the same as if n calls to
random() had been made.  The latter is particularly useful for multi-
threaded programs, creating one instance of the random.Random() class for
each thread, then using .jumpahead() to force each instance to use a
non-overlapping segment of the full period.</li>
<li>random.py's seed() function is new.  For bit-for-bit compatibility with
prior releases, use the whseed function instead.  The new seed function
addresses two problems:  (1) The old function couldn't produce more than
about 2**24 distinct internal states; the new one about 2**45 (the best
that can be done in the Wichmann-Hill generator).  (2) The old function
sometimes produced identical internal states when passed distinct
integers, and there was no simple way to predict when that would happen;
the new one guarantees to produce distinct internal states for all
arguments in [0, 27814431486576L).</li>
<li>The socket module now supports raw packets on Linux.  The socket
family is AF_PACKET.</li>
<li>test_capi.py is a start at running tests of the Python C API.  The tests
are implemented by the new Modules/_testmodule.c.</li>
<li>A new extension module, _symtable, provides provisional access to the
internal symbol table used by the Python compiler.  A higher-level
interface will be added on top of _symtable in a future release.</li>
<li>Removed the obsolete soundex module.</li>
<li>xml.dom.minidom now uses the standard DOM exceptions. Node supports
the isSameNode method; NamedNodeMap the get method.</li>
<li>xml.sax.expatreader supports the lexical handler property; it
generates comment, startCDATA, and endCDATA events.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows changes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Build procedure:  the zlib project is built in a different way that
ensures the zlib header files used can no longer get out of synch with
the zlib binary used.  See PCbuildreadme.txt for details.  Your old
zlib-related directories can be deleted; you'll need to download fresh
source for zlib and unpack it into a new directory.</li>
<li>Build:  New subproject _test for the benefit of test_capi.py (see above).</li>
<li>Build:  New subproject _symtable, for new DLL _symtable.pyd (a nascent
interface to some Python compiler internals).</li>
<li>Build:  Subproject ucnhash is gone, since the code was folded into the
unicodedata subproject.</li>

<h2>What's New in Python 2.1 alpha 1?</h2>
<p>Core language, builtins, and interpreter</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">There is a new Unicode companion to the PyObject_Str() API
called PyObject_Unicode(). It behaves in the same way as the
former, but assures that the returned value is an Unicode object
(applying the usual coercion if necessary).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The comparison operators support &quot;rich comparison overloading&quot; (PEP
207).  C extension types can provide a rich comparison function in
the new tp_richcompare slot in the type object.  The cmp() function
and the C function PyObject_Compare() first try the new rich
comparison operators before trying the old 3-way comparison.  There
is also a new C API PyObject_RichCompare() (which also falls back on
the old 3-way comparison, but does not constrain the outcome of the
rich comparison to a Boolean result).</p>
<p>The rich comparison function takes two objects (at least one of
which is guaranteed to have the type that provided the function) and
an integer indicating the opcode, which can be Py_LT, Py_LE, Py_EQ,
Py_NE, Py_GT, Py_GE (for &lt;, &lt;=, ==, !=, &gt;, &gt;=), and returns a Python
object, which may be NotImplemented (in which case the tp_compare
slot function is used as a fallback, if defined).</p>
<p>Classes can overload individual comparison operators by defining one
or more of the methods__lt__, __le__, __eq__, __ne__, __gt__,
__ge__.  There are no explicit &quot;reflected argument&quot; versions of
these; instead, __lt__ and __gt__ are each other's reflection,
likewise for__le__ and __ge__; __eq__ and __ne__ are their own
reflection (similar at the C level).  No other implications are
made; in particular, Python does not assume that == is the Boolean
inverse of !=, or that &lt; is the Boolean inverse of &gt;=.  This makes
it possible to define types with partial orderings.</p>
<p>Classes or types that want to implement (in)equality tests but not
the ordering operators (i.e. unordered types) should implement ==
and !=, and raise an error for the ordering operators.</p>
<p>It is possible to define types whose rich comparison results are not
Boolean; e.g. a matrix type might want to return a matrix of bits
for A &lt; B, giving elementwise comparisons.  Such types should ensure
that any interpretation of their value in a Boolean context raises
an exception, e.g. by defining __nonzero__ (or the tp_nonzero slot
at the C level) to always raise an exception.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Complex numbers use rich comparisons to define == and != but raise
an exception for &lt;, &lt;=, &gt; and &gt;=.  Unfortunately, this also means
that cmp() of two complex numbers raises an exception when the two
numbers differ.  Since it is not mathematically meaningful to compare
complex numbers except for equality, I hope that this doesn't break
too much code.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The outcome of comparing non-numeric objects of different types is
not defined by the language, other than that it's arbitrary but
consistent (see the Reference Manual).  An implementation detail changed
in 2.1a1 such that None now compares less than any other object.  Code
relying on this new behavior (like code that relied on the previous
behavior) does so at its own risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Functions and methods now support getting and setting arbitrarily
named attributes (PEP 232).  Functions have a new __dict__
(a.k.a. func_dict) which hold the function attributes.  Methods get
and set attributes on their underlying im_func.  It is a TypeError
to set an attribute on a bound method.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The xrange() object implementation has been improved so that
xrange(sys.maxint) can be used on 64-bit platforms.  There's still a
limitation that in this case len(xrange(sys.maxint)) can't be
calculated, but the common idiom &quot;for i in xrange(sys.maxint)&quot; will
work fine as long as the index i doesn't actually reach 2**31.
(Python uses regular ints for sequence and string indices; fixing
that is much more work.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Two changes to from...import:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>&quot;from M import X&quot; now works even if (after loading module M)
sys.modules['M'] is not a real module; it's basically a getattr()
operation with AttributeError exceptions changed into ImportError.</li>
<li>&quot;from M import *&quot; now looks for M.__all__ to decide which names to
import; if M.__all__ doesn't exist, it uses M.__dict__.keys() but
filters out names starting with '_' as before.  Whether or not
__all__ exists, there's no restriction on the type of M.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p class="first">File objects have a new method, xreadlines().  This is the fastest
way to iterate over all lines in a file:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>for line in file.xreadlines():</dt>
<dd><p class="first last">...do something to line...</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>See the xreadlines module (mentioned below) for how to do this for
other file-like objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Even if you don't use file.xreadlines(), you may expect a speedup on
line-by-line input.  The file.readline() method has been optimized
quite a bit in platform-specific ways:  on systems (like Linux) that
support flockfile(), getc_unlocked(), and funlockfile(), those are
used by default.  On systems (like Windows) without getc_unlocked(),
a complicated (but still thread-safe) method using fgets() is used by
default.</p>
<p>You can force use of the fgets() method by #define'ing
USE_FGETS_IN_GETLINE at build time (it may be faster than
getc_unlocked()).</p>
<p>You can force fgets() not to be used by #define'ing
DONT_USE_FGETS_IN_GETLINE (this is the first thing to try if std test
test_bufio.py fails -- and let us know if it does!).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In addition, the fileinput module, while still slower than the other
methods on most platforms, has been sped up too, by using
file.readlines(sizehint).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Support for run-time warnings has been added, including a new
command line option (-W) to specify the disposition of warnings.
See the description of the warnings module below.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Extensive changes have been made to the coercion code.  This mostly
affects extension modules (which can now implement mixed-type
numerical operators without having to use coercion), but
occasionally, in boundary cases the coercion semantics have changed
subtly.  Since this was a terrible gray area of the language, this
is considered an improvement.  Also note that __rcmp__ is no longer
supported -- instead of calling __rcmp__, __cmp__ is called with
reflected arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">In connection with the coercion changes, a new built-in singleton
object, NotImplemented is defined.  This can be returned for
operations that wish to indicate they are not implemented for a
particular combination of arguments.  From C, this is
Py_NotImplemented.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The interpreter accepts now bytecode files on the command line even
if they do not have a .pyc or .pyo extension. On Linux, after executing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>import imp,sys,string
magic = string.join([&quot;\x%.2x&quot; % ord(c) for c in imp.get_magic()],&quot;&quot;)
reg = ':pyc:M::%s::%s:' % (magic, sys.executable)
open(&quot;/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register&quot;,&quot;wb&quot;).write(reg)</p>
<blockquote>
any byte code file can be used as an executable (i.e. as an argument
to execve(2)).</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">%[xXo] formats of negative Python longs now produce a sign
character.  In 1.6 and earlier, they never produced a sign,
and raised an error if the value of the long was too large
to fit in a Python int.  In 2.0, they produced a sign if and
only if too large to fit in an int.  This was inconsistent
across platforms (because the size of an int varies across
platforms), and inconsistent with hex() and oct().  Example:</p>
<pre class="doctest-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;%x&quot; % -0x42L
'-42'      # in 2.1
'ffffffbe' # in 2.0 and before, on 32-bit machines
&gt;&gt;&gt; hex(-0x42L)
'-0x42L'   # in all versions of Python
</pre>
<p>The behavior of %d formats for negative Python longs remains
the same as in 2.0 (although in 1.6 and before, they raised
an error if the long didn't fit in a Python int).</p>
<p>%u formats don't make sense for Python longs, but are allowed
and treated the same as %d in 2.1.  In 2.0, a negative long
formatted via %u produced a sign if and only if too large to
fit in an int.  In 1.6 and earlier, a negative long formatted
via %u raised an error if it was too big to fit in an int.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Dictionary objects have an odd new method, popitem().  This removes
an arbitrary item from the dictionary and returns it (in the form of
a (key, value) pair).  This can be useful for algorithms that use a
dictionary as a bag of &quot;to do&quot; items and repeatedly need to pick one
item.  Such algorithms normally end up running in quadratic time;
using popitem() they can usually be made to run in linear time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard library</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In the time module, the time argument to the functions strftime,
localtime, gmtime, asctime and ctime is now optional, defaulting to
the current time (in the local timezone).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The ftplib module now defaults to passive mode, which is deemed a
more useful default given that clients are often inside firewalls
these days.  Note that this could break if ftplib is used to connect
to a <em>server</em> that is inside a firewall, from outside; this is
expected to be a very rare situation.  To fix that, you can call
ftp.set_pasv(0).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The module site now treats .pth files not only for path configuration,
but also supports extensions to the initialization code: Lines starting
with import are executed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">There's a new module, warnings, which implements a mechanism for
issuing and filtering warnings.  There are some new built-in
exceptions that serve as warning categories, and a new command line
option, -W, to control warnings (e.g. -Wi ignores all warnings, -We
turns warnings into errors).  warnings.warn(message[, category])
issues a warning message; this can also be called from C as
PyErr_Warn(category, message).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A new module xreadlines was added.  This exports a single factory
function, xreadlines().  The intention is that this code is the
absolutely fastest way to iterate over all lines in an open
file(-like) object:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import xreadlines
for line in xreadlines.xreadlines(file):
    ...do something to line...

This is equivalent to the previous the speed record holder using
file.readlines(sizehint).  Note that if file is a real file object
(as opposed to a file-like object), this is equivalent:

for line in file.xreadlines():
    ...do something to line...
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The bisect module has new functions bisect_left, insort_left,
bisect_right and insort_right.  The old names bisect and insort
are now aliases for bisect_right and insort_right.  XXX_right
and XXX_left methods differ in what happens when the new element
compares equal to one or more elements already in the list:  the
XXX_left methods insert to the left, the XXX_right methods to the
right.  Code that doesn't care where equal elements end up should
continue to use the old, short names (&quot;bisect&quot; and &quot;insort&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The new curses.panel module wraps the panel library that forms part
of SYSV curses and ncurses.  Contributed by Thomas Gellekum.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The SocketServer module now sets the allow_reuse_address flag by
default in the TCPServer class.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A new function, sys._getframe(), returns the stack frame pointer of
the caller.  This is intended only as a building block for
higher-level mechanisms such as string interpolation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The pyexpat module supports a number of new handlers, which are
available only in expat 1.2. If invocation of a callback fails, it
will report an additional frame in the traceback. Parser objects
participate now in garbage collection. If expat reports an unknown
encoding, pyexpat will try to use a Python codec; that works only
for single-byte charsets. The parser type objects is exposed as
XMLParserObject.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">xml.dom now offers standard definitions for symbolic node type and
exception code constants, and a hierarchy of DOM exceptions. minidom
was adjusted to use them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The conformance of xml.dom.minidom to the DOM specification was
improved. It detects a number of additional error cases; the
previous/next relationship works even when the tree is modified;
Node supports the normalize() method; NamedNodeMap, DocumentType and
DOMImplementation classes were added; Element supports the
hasAttribute and hasAttributeNS methods; and Text supports the splitText
method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Build issues</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For Unix (and Unix-compatible) builds, configuration and building of
extension modules is now greatly automated.  Rather than having to
edit the Modules/Setup file to indicate which modules should be
built and where their include files and libraries are, a
distutils-based setup.py script now takes care of building most
extension modules.  All extension modules built this way are built
as shared libraries.  Only a few modules that must be linked
statically are still listed in the Setup file; you won't need to
edit their configuration.</li>
<li>Python should now build out of the box on Cygwin.  If it doesn't,
mail to Jason Tishler (jlt63 at users.sourceforge.net).</li>
<li>Python now always uses its own (renamed) implementation of getopt()
-- there's too much variation among C library getopt()
implementations.</li>
<li>C++ compilers are better supported; the CXX macro is always set to a
C++ compiler if one is found.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows changes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>select module:  By default under Windows, a select() call
can specify no more than 64 sockets.  Python now boosts
this Microsoft default to 512.  If you need even more than
that, see the MS docs (you'll need to #define FD_SETSIZE
and recompile Python from source).</li>
<li>Support for Windows 3.1, DOS and OS/2 is gone.  The Lib/dos-8x3
subdirectory is no more!</li>
</ul>
