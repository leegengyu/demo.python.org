FSF Statement
=============

Eben Moglen, on behalf of the FSF, writes:

    The Free Software Foundation thanks the board of the Python Foundation
      and Guido van Rossum for their cooperation in developing a license for
      Python 2.0.1 that is fully compatible with the GNU General Public
      License (GPL).   Python 2.0.1c1 and all future versions released under
      the same license are free software that may be freely combined with
      programs released under GPL.  FSF recognizes the enormous value of
      Python for developers of free software; we are pleased that all prior
      difficulties with the fullest use of Python in free software projects
      have now been resolved.
