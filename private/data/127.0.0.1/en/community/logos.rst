The Python Logo
---------------

Projects and companies that use Python are encouraged to incorporate the Python
logo on their websites, brochures, packaging, and elsewhere to indicate suitability
for use with Python or implementation in Python.

Currently, the following larger sized and vector variants of the logo are 
available: 

- `PNG format <python-logo-master-v3-TM.png>`_ -- the original master which should open as a vector image in Adobe Fireworks

- `PNG format (flattened) <python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png>`_

- `Photoshop format <python-logo-master-v3-TM.psd>`_

- `SVG format (generic SVG export from Inkscape) <python-logo-generic.svg>`_

- `SVG format (Inkscape-specific SVG) <python-logo-inkscape.svg>`_

The font used in the logo is called &quot;Flux Regular&quot;.  The PSF owns a copy
but we cannot distribute it, except for work on the PSF's behalf.

Guidelines for Use
------------------

The Python logo is a trademark of the Python Software Foundation, which is
responsible for defending against any damaging or confusing uses of the
trademark.

See the `PSF Trademark Usage Policy </psf/trademarks>`_. 

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate
use of Python or suitability for Python.  However, please `ask first <mailto:psf-trademarks%40python.org>`_ when using a derived version of the
logo or when in doubt.
