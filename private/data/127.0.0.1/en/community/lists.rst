Python Mailing Lists and Newsgroups
-----------------------------------

Here's an overview of the mail and news resources for python. A complete
listing of python.org's public mailing lists
is also available.

To request a new list, send e-mail to postmaster @ python.org; please check 
first to make sure a similar list does not already exist. 

Mailing lists for users speaking languages other than
English are listed in the `non-english python resources <http://wiki.python.org/moin/Languages>`_ guide, which includes mailing
lists, translated and original non-English documentation, and other
resources.

comp.lang.python
----------------

`comp.lang.python <news:comp.lang.python>`_ is a high-volume
Usenet open (not moderated) newsgroup for general discussions and
questions about Python.  You can also access it as a mailing list through
`python-list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list>`_.

Pretty much anything Python-related is fair game for discussion, and the group 
is even fairly tolerant of off-topic digressions; there have been entertaining 
discussions of topics such as floating point, good software design, and other 
programming languages such as Lisp and Forth. 

Most discussion on comp.lang.python is about developing with Python, not about 
development of the Python interpreter itself. Some of the core developers still 
read the list, but most of them don't. Occasionally comp.lang.python 
suggestions have resulted in an enhancement proposal being written, leading to 
a new Python feature. If you find a bug in Python, don't send it to 
comp.lang.python; file a bug report in `the issue tracker 
<http://bugs.python.org/>`_. 

Items posted on the Usenet group appear on the mailing list, and vice
versa (bidirectional gateway). Due to the mysteries of Usenet, the
order in which items show up may vary.

Rudeness and personal attacks, even in reaction to blatant flamebait, are 
strongly frowned upon. People may strongly disagree on an issue, but usually 
discussion remains civil. In case of an actual flamebait posting, you can 
ignore it, quietly plonk the offending poster in your killfile or mail filters, 
or write a sharp but still-polite response, but at all costs resist the urge to 
flame back. Generally comp.lang.python is a high-signal, low-noise group. It's 
also a high-traffic group, running at around 200 posts per day. 

There are several different archives: 

- `Google Groups archive of comp.lang.python <http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/topics>`_

- `python.org archive of python-list <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/>`_

- `gmane.org archive of python-list <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.general>`_

comp.lang.python in non-English
-------------------------------

There are some non-English language versions of this newsgroup. The links 
provided here are to the Google Groups archive for each: `de.comp.lang.python 
<https://groups.google.com/group/de.comp.lang.python/topics?lnk=gschg>`_ 
(German), `it.comp.lang.python 
<https://groups.google.com/group/it.comp.lang.python/topics>`_ (Italian), 
`pl.comp.lang.python 
<https://groups.google.com/group/pl.comp.lang.python/topics>`_ (Polish), 
`fr.comp.lang.python 
<https://groups.google.com/group/fr.comp.lang.python/topics>`_ (French), and 
`cz.comp.lang.python 
<http://groups.google.com/group/cz.comp.lang.python/topics>`_ (Czech).

comp.lang.python.announce
-------------------------

`comp.lang.python.announce <news:comp.lang.python.announce>`_ is a
low-volume moderated forum for Python-related announcements. New
modules and programs are announced here, and it's where
`PEPs </dev/peps/>`_ are posted to get comments from the community.
You'll also see announcements for conferences.

This is a moderated newsgroup carrying at most perhaps 10 to 20 messages per 
week, so it's an easy way to be keep up-to-date on what's new in the Python 
world. See the `comp.lang.python.announce posting guidelines 
<http://www.python.org/community/lists/clpya-guidelines.txt>`_ for guidelines 
on submitting announcements. 

It is also available as a read-only mailing list, python-announce. Subscribing 
can be done via the `python-announce list information page 
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-announce-list>`_. 

comp.lang.python.announce is moderated by a team of people. If you need to 
contact them directly, e.g. to ask why a particular message was rejected, write 
to clpa-moderators-owner @ python.org. 

There are several archives for comp.lang.python.announce: 

- `Google Groups archive of comp.lang.python.announce <http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python.announce>`_

- `python.org archive of python-announce <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-announce-list>`_

tutor
-----

The `tutor mailing list <http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor>`_ is for 
users who want to ask questions about learning computer programming with 
Python. An `archive of the list <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/tutor/>`_ is 
available. 

People interested in learning about programming with Python are
encouraged to join, as are experienced users interested in helping
others learn -- teaching other people is one of the best ways to learn
more yourself!

python-dev
----------

*Note:* python-dev is for work on developing Python (fixing bugs and adding new 
features to Python itself); if you're having problems writing a Python program, 
please post to comp.lang.python. 

python-dev is the heart of Python's development. Practically everyone with 
Subversion write privileges is on python-dev, and first drafts of PEPs are 
often posted here for initial review and rewriting before their more public 
appearance on python-announce. 

Anyone can subscribe to python-dev, though your subscription will have
to be approved, resulting in a delay of a day or two before you start
receiving e-mail. The list address accepts e-mail from non-members
(after a delay in moderation, so subscribing is a Good Idea), and
the `python-dev archives <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/>`_
are public.

There is also a gmane gateway to the mailing list: 

- `gmane.org archive of python-dev <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.devel>`_

python-ideas mailing list
-------------------------

The python-ideas list is for discussing more speculative design ideas. 

- `python-ideas Mailman interface <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-ideas>`_

- `gmane.org archive of python-ideas <http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.ideas>`_

Porting mailing list
--------------------

The `python-porting list 
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-porting>`_ focuses on porting 
Python code between versions, mainly between 2.x and 3.x code.

Special Interest Groups
-----------------------

Special Interest Groups (SIGs) are smaller communities focused on a particular 
topic or application such as databases, Python on MacOS, etc. Every SIG has a 
mailing list of its own. See `the SIG page 
<http://www.python.org/community/sigs/>`_ for more information. 

SIGs vary in their success. Some, such as the XML, Database, and Distutils 
SIGs, have produced specifications and software that are now used throughout 
the Python community. Not all SIGs are as productive, though, and some sputter 
along for years without ever finalizing an implementation or a document.

python-checkins
---------------

The `python-checkins mailing list 
<http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-checkins>`_ receives an 
automatically generated message for each change committed to the Python 
Subversion tree. python-checkins makes it easy for developers to know what is 
happening in the repository. The volume of traffic on this list varies widely 
based on developer activity.

python-help
-----------

The python-help mailing list is python.org's help desk. You can ask a group of 
knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems. 

You can send email to python-help by writing to help @ python.org for 
individual support. Mail sent there lands in the mailbox of a small group of 
volunteers who may reply to reasonable requests for help, depending on their 
area of expertise. Using it is much preferred to sending mail directly to Guido 
or some other individual, but less preferable than posting to comp.lang.python. 
In all cases, try `searching the various archives 
<http://www.python.org/search/>`_ first. 

When you ask a question, be sure to give your configuration: what hardware 
platform, what OS (and version), what Python version, and (when using Tkinter) 
what Tcl/Tk version you are using. If you're using an older Python version, try 
upgrading to the latest version first -- things often get better! 

You can't subscribe to python-help -- it is not for bystanders, only for 
questioners to submit questions and for helpers to receive and field them. The 
archives are not accessible, to protect the questioners' privacy. If you would 
like to help answer questions, send your qualifications to webmaster @ 
python.org. 

When you send a message to python-help, you will get an automated response. 
Your message is still delivered to the volunteers, and you will only receive 
this automated response once every approximately three months.
