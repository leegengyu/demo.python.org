Submitting to the Python Job Board
==================================

`The Python Job Board </community/jobs/>`_ is a free resource to help members of the Python
community find paid work. It is for real jobs only (that is, only for
paid openings that currently exist and are actively being hired for)
that have some connection with the Python programming language. If there
doesn't seem to be a strong Python connection, the submission may be
ignored.

Unpaid volunteer positions will not be posted on the jobs page. If you
have some Python-related volunteer post, please post a description in
the Wiki on the `Volunteer Opportunities page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/VolunteerOpportunities>`_; register with
the Wiki and then follow the &quot;EditText&quot; link at the bottom of the Wiki
page.

The Job Board is run by volunteers in their spare time, please be
patient.

**Cost:** Job listings are free.  Please donate to the
Python Software Foundation, a US scientific and
educational public charity (non-profit).
US organizations and individuals may be able to claim tax exemption on donations.

Your listing will appear on the `Job Board page </community/jobs/>`_, the RSS
feed and on `Twitter <http://www.twitter.com/pyjobo>`_. To make the most of this, please
follow the steps below:

- Descriptions should be sent in **plain-text** (ASCII or UTF-8) and use our template below. Please don't use non-text formats such as Word .doc or RTF - they will be rejected.

- Please copy the following template into a plain text editor such as **Notepad** and edit it replacing the example information with your information and deleting any parts that aren't necessary:     .. code-block::      `Sample Company Inc. (Agency?) <;http://www.example.com>`__ (New York, NY, USA)     ========================================================================================          **Job Description**:          Short description of position (this will be     used as a summary in the RSS feed and Twitter - 140 characters for     your company name plus the first 10-15 words of your description)          **Requirements**          * Requirement item 1     * Requirement item 2     * Requirement item N          **About the company**          A short description of the company          **What Python is used for**: if it's not obvious from the Job     Description.          **Contact Info:**          * **Contact**: J. Random HR Manager     * **E-mail contact**: example@example.com     * **Other Contact Info**: other contact info if desired.     * **Web**: http://www.example.com/your/job/page.html     * **Telecommuting OK** / * **No telecommuting** (remove one)     When filling in the sections of the template bearing in mind the following:    - **ALL** the punctuation in the template above is *extremely* important. Please make sure all of the following are left in place as they are in the template:     .. code-block::      ` <; > _ == ** * :  - We use a lightweight markup syntax called `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and, if needed, we will fix the markup of postings. If you want a preview of your posting, `try this web page <http://www.tele3.cz/jbar/rest/rest.html>`_.  - Descriptions may be edited for brevity, clarity, or uniformity. Please keep your posting as short as possible. See the existing jobs listed for examples of acceptable posting length.  - We will not accept postings that are considered to be highly similar to an existing submission. For example, when two recruiters are trying to fill the same position.

- Attach the resulting file to an email and send to `jobs@python.org  <mailto:jobs%40python.org>`_.      *Requests sent to any other email addresses or lists may not be handled promptly and may even be deleted as spam.*     You should receive an automated reply immediately.  When the job is posted, you will receive confirmation email from one of the Job Board volunteers.     Please note that the Python Job Board is maintained by volunteers. While we try to respond to requests promptly, sometimes life gets in the way.  Please be patient.

- When the job gets filled, please let us know by emailing `jobs@python.org <mailto:jobs%40python.org>`_. Job listings will be deleted after three months. We do not &quot;bump&quot; job postings, so please do not re-submit a job just because it is not at the top of the list.
