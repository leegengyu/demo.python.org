SIG for XML Processing in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list has been created to provide a forum for discussion and
implementation of tools to make Python an excellent choice for XML
processing.

Mission Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

XML is the `Extensible Markup Language <http://w3.org/xml/>`_,
a standard defined by the `World Wide Web Consortium <http://w3.org>`_.
Originally developed as a standard to enable the interchange of structured
data, XML has expanded to encompass databases, distributed computing,
and so on.
The `XML Topic Guide <http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/topics/>`_,
maintained by the XML SIG, contains
links to documentation, source, and so on.

While Python includes basic XML processing capabilities, the goal of this
SIG is to make Python become *the* premier language for XML
processing.
The SIG, through the
`mailing list <http://www.python.org/pipermail/xml-sig/>`_ and
the `PyXML <http://pyxml.sf.net>`_ project hosted
on `SourceForge <http://www.sf.net>`_, is helping to
decide what software is
required for this purpose, and coordinate its implementation and
documentation.
