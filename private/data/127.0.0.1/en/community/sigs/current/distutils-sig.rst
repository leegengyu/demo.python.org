Python Distutils-SIG: Introduction
==================================

Charter
-------

The Distutils-SIG exists to discuss the design, implementation,
    and maintenance
    of a suite of module distribution utilities for Python.
    These utilities are grouped in the 'distutils' package in Python.

The goal of distutils is to make building, packaging,
    distributing, and installing Python modules, extensions, and
    applications painless and standardized.

There are also third-party tools built on the top of distutils,
    that are using the Distutils mailing list as their home.

Namely: 

- setuptools

- zc.buildout

If you are packaging a Python package, this SIG is probably a
    good starting point to ask questions.

The goal of Distutils-SIG is also to try to catch the good bits
    and practices from third-party projects and insert them in
    Distutils itself to serve the community.  If you are working on
    any tool that helps distributing packages, and think you can help
    making Distutils better, please join us!
