SIG for Ultra Large-Scale Systems
=================================

This special interest group (SIG) exists in order to discuss the
emerging field of computing in the context of ultra large-scale
systems and how such systems relate to or can be built with Python.

The term &quot;Ultra Large-Scale Systems&quot; comes out of the research that
was done in 2005-2006 by the
`Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/>`_'s
`ULS Systems <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/>`_
team. It entails the &quot;creation&quot; of systems of the next 10-20 years
(and possibly beyond), systems that will be too large for current
design, development, management, and interaction practices. These
systems will come into being through amalgamated services united to
provide solutions for a particular (potentially very large) problem
space.

The `official report <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/files/ULS_Book2006.pdf>`_
is rather long but is available for free.  Shorter
summaries are also available. There is one that gives a
`fairly concise summary <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/files/OOPSLA06.pdf>`_,
especially on slide 22 and 23.  Although that particular
presentation's content is focused on defense applications, these
problems are of deep interest/concern to industries such as the
medical field and other organizations that will have extensive and
diverse infrastructure and services operating in diverse and
potentially hostile environments.

`Another presentation <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/files/roadmap.pdf>`_ outlines the
research that needs to be actively pursued in order to make ULS
systems a reality (see pages 69, 38, 37 -- note that the dotted 6.x.y
number refer to sections in the official ULS report.
