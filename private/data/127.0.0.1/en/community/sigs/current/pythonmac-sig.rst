SIG on Python for the Apple Macintosh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python-Macintosh SIG is used to foster discussions about
      Mac-specific issues of Python. The list is primarily meant to
      discuss design and implementation of Python on the Mac, and
      possibly coordinate the actual implementation work done.  The
      topics can include such varying things as a Python development
      environment, using Python for CGI-scripts, OSA support, OpenDoc
      parts, MacOS toolbox access, Tk, etc.

While the list is developer-oriented this should not stop
      python-users (or, in other words, people developing with Python
      instead of for Python) to join in the discussions.
