SIG for Standard Library Development
====================================

The Stdlib-SIG is for development, improvement, and maintenance of the
Python standard library.  Work is being done to
break out the standard library and test suite as a separate package, available
to developers of alternate Python implementations
such as `Jython <http://www.jython.org>`_ and
`IronPython <http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython>`_.

Discussion takes place on
`the stdlib-sig mailing list <http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/stdlib-sig>`_.
