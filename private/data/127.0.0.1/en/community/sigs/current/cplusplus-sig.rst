SIG for development of Python/C++ integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Python C++ SIG is a forum for discussions about the integration
of Python and C++, with an emphasis on the development of the
Boost.Python
library.  At the point of
this writing (Jan 2002), Boost.Python is undergoing a major rewrite to
add powerful new features and to take
full advantage of the new type system introduced in Python
2.2. Suggestions regarding the direction of the development work and
contributions in the form of source code should be posted to this SIG.

About `Boost.Python <http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html>`_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Boost.Python is a popular open-source tool for
  interfacing Python and C++. Boost.Python is built on
  accessible, well-maintained, well documented components
  (the Boost C++ Library), so it does not tie its users to
  the services of any one programmer or organization.
  Developers worldwide have contributed significant
  unsolicited improvements to the project. The main
  developer and coordinator of the library is
  `David Abrahams <http://www.boost.org/people/dave_abrahams.htm>`_.

Development goals

The following sections describe the current development
