email package SIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 
email
package is a standard Python package that comes with Python.  This SIG's
mission is to define, implement, enhance, and maintain the email package for
Python.  Goals include:

- Improving the API
- Improving performance and usability
- Adding support for additional email RFCs

Several versions of the email package are available, and may be included with
your Python distribution.  All are also available as distutils-based
standalone packages from the
`Python Cheese Shop <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/email>`_.  Here is the breakdown of package availability and
compatibility:

**email package version**   **released with**   **compatible with**

2.5.7   Python 2.3.6 [*]   Python 2.1 to 2.5

3.0.1   Python 2.4.3   Python 2.3 to 2.5

4.0   Python 2.5 [**]   Python 2.3 to 2.5

[*] The last release of the Python 2.3 family was 2.3.5, which included
email 2.5.6.  If Python 2.3.6 ever gets released it will include email 2.5.7.

[**] Python 2.5 is currently under development and has not yet been
released.

There is, of course, always more to do, so please join the 
email sig
mailing list
(`archives <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/email-sig/>`_)
for further discussions on the direction of this SIG.  Note that this SIG
replaces the old mimelib project at SourceForge.  Use the Python project
trackers for all bug reports.
