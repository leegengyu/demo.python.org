Over a dozen graphical user-interface Python modules have been
developed.  While this speaks to the power of Python's extension
capabilities, there is significant interest in defining a commonly
available GUI system for Python that would facilitate the interchange
of and cooperation on tools, such as software development
environments, that require or benefit from GUI interfaces.
