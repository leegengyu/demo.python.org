  New postings to the mailing list will be rejected, but the archives
  of the old list are still available for perusal.  See the `SIGs home page </community/sigs/>`_ for info about active and
  inactive lists.

This list was intended for the discussion of the issues concerning the
Python programming environment - the facilities, including editors,
interpreter, debuggers, browsers, documentation, and so forth,
instrumental in the actual act of Python programming.  Discussions may
cover use of and problems with existing facilities, as well as efforts
to produce new tools and solutions.  The overall orientation is to
foster the development of this programming environment.
