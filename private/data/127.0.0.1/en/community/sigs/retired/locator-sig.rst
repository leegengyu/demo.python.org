Python Locator SIG
------------------

**MISSING**
~~~~~~~~~~~

  New postings to the mailing list will be rejected, but the archives
  of the old list are still available for perusal.  See the `SIGs home page </community/sigs/../index.html>`_ for info about active and
  inactive lists.

Further information:

- eGroups archives
- The old `list mission statement <mission>`_
- The `catalog-sig </community/sigs/current/catalog-sig/>`_ can be seen as a revival of the locator-sig.
