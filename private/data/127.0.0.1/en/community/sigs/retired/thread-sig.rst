SIG on Process Threading in Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **MISSING**

    New postings to the mailing list will be rejected, but the archives
    of the old list are still available for perusal.  See the `SIGs home page </community/sigs>`_ for info about active and
    inactive lists.

This list's mission is to improve the status of threading in Python. 

Specifically:

    - Python will have a sufficiently powerful threading 	interface that users can concentrate on using threads rather 	than writing threading tools.
- There will be sufficient Python threading documentation.
- Python should support threading well on every platform with 	decent native OS support.
- There should be some kind of answer to the problems caused 	by Python's central interpreter lock.
- The issues of threading with respect to multiprocessor 	machines are addressed.
