Compiler-SIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This SIG provides a forum for discussing compilation and program
analysis issues.  Unlike most SIGs, it does not have a specific
mandate or deliverable.  There are several independent projects to
develop compilers, type checkers, and related tools.  The CPython and
JPython distributions also contain compilers, of course; future
versions of these compilers will also be discussed on this sig.

There will likely be some overlap between the types-sig and the
compiler-sig:  The compiler will be responsible for implementing the
type checker.

This SIG grew out of a Developers' Day session at the 8th
International Python Conference.  Ka-Ping Yee took `notes on the session. </files/sigs/dev-day-notes.txt>`_
