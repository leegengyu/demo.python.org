SIG on Python bindings for Objective-C/NeXTSTEP/OpenStep
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **MISSING**

    New postings to the mailing list will be rejected, but the archives
    of the old list are still available for perusal.  See the `SIGs home page </community/sigs/>`_ for info about active and
    inactive lists.

    The Python / Objective C connection lives on in the `PyObjC project <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyobjc>`_ at
    SourceForge!

The purpose of this SIG is to complete a Python extension module
binding the Objective-C and Python runtime systems. Goals include:

- Providing the ability to dynamically call from Objective-C to Python and vice versa.
- Resolving the syntactic differences between the languages.
- Providing the ability to move inheritance, interface, and implementation easily across the Python/Objective-C boundary.
