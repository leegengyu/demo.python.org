The Python type system SIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This list has been created for discussions on issues related to
Python's type system.

Recently, the types SIG has come under attack for inactivity, and
in response Paul Prescod has offered to guide the SIG towards
accomplishing a single specific goal: to develop an optional static
typing system for Python.  The `December 1999 archives <http://www.python.org/pipermail/types-sig/1999-December/date.html>`_ of the SIG show the discussion that lead
to this decision.
