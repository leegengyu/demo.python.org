Internet Relay Chat
===================

There are several Python-related channels on the Freenode IRC network.
All channels are available by using the Internet Relay Chat server
*irc.freenode.net*.

For short questions, you can get immediate help by visiting the
**#python** channel.  You will need to first register your nickname
with FreeNode, using the `nickname setup instructions <http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup>`_.  You should
also read the `FAQ for the #python channel <http://www.purl.org/wiki/python/PythonFaq>`_.

German speakers can use the **#python.de** channel on either
*irc.freenode.net* or *IRCnet*.  The channel on *irc.freenode.net* is much
more active than the one on *IRCnet*.

Portuguese speakers can use the **#python-pt** channel on
*irc.freenode.net*.

Spanish speakers can use the **#pyar** channel, from the Python Argentina
user group, on *irc.freenode.org*.
