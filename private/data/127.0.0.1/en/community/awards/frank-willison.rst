The Frank Willison Award for Contributions to the Python Community
==================================================================

    Contributions can encompass so much more than code.  A successful
    software community requires time, dedication, communication, and
    education as well as elegant code.  With the Frank Willison Award,
    we hoped to acknowledge all of those things.

    --Tim O'Reilly

**The Frank Willison Award for Contributions to the Python Community**
is given annually to a person judged to have made an outstanding
contribution to the Python community.  The award was established in
memory of Frank Willison, a Python enthusiast and O'Reilly
editor-in-chief, who died in July 2001.  Tim O'Reilly wrote In Memory
of Frank Willison, which includes a collection of quotes from
Frank's insightful and witty writing.  O'Reilly Media maintains an
online archive of Frank Willison's column, &quot;Frankly Speaking&quot;.

`O'Reilly Media <http://oreilly.com/>`_ presents the Frank Willison Award annually at
`OSCON, the O'Reilly Open Source Convention <http://conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon/>`_.  The recipient is
chosen by O'Reilly Media in consultation with Guido van Rossum and
delegates of the `Python Software Foundation </psf/>`_.  The award
consists of a framed certificate and one free pass to a future OSCON.

2005.

`Georg Brandl (2011) <#id8>`_
-----------------------------

Georg has been a core contributor to CPython since 2005, contributing bug
fixes for compiler internals and modules such as pdb. His most widely known
contributions are to Python's documentation, through writing as well as by
creating and maintaining the Sphinx tool chain for converting
reStructuredText input files to more easily consumed formats such as HTML
and PDF.

The video announcing Georg's award at OSCON 2011 is
`available on YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I708QrOlM74>`_.

Georg is a PhD student of Physics. He works at the Munich research reactor
slash neutron source on magnetism, researching novel materials for the
computing of tomorrow. He uses Python to control experiments consisting of
dozens of individual devices, and for teaching other scientists how to do
so efficiently.

When he is not working on Python-related projects, Georg likes to cycle and
to cook.

`Christian Tismer (2010) <#id9>`_
---------------------------------

Christian Tismer's contributions to the technology behind Python have focused
on performance. For example, he is the founder of the `Stackless Python <http://www.stackless.com>`_ project, a micro-threading system with the first
implementation of generators and continuations. You can learn more about
Stackless from the project's `history page <http://www.disinterest.org/resource/stackless/2.6-docs-html/stackless-python.html#history>`_
and this `IBM developerWorks interview with Christian <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-pyth7.html>`_ by David Mertz.

Christian also co-founded `PyPy <http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/>`_,
an implementation of Python in Python, with Armin Rigo and Holger Krekel.
Christian worked on PyPy full time for a period, using EU funding. Later, he
worked on the JIT compiler `Psyco <http://www.psyco.org/>`_ with Raymond
Hettinger to create `Psyco V2 <http://codespeak.net/pipermail/pypy-dev/2009q3/005288.html>`_. Most
recently, he has been employed by `CCP Games <http://www.ccpgames.com/>`_ to
work on combining Stackless and Psyco and updating them to support 64-bit
systems.

In 1997, as one of his earliest contributions to the Python community,
Christian launched the `Starship Python <http://starship.python.net/>`_
website?

When he's not working on Python, Christian enjoys watching movies, reading,
and playing piano. You can follow him on twitter `@ctismer <http://twitter.com/ctismer>`_.?

`Mark Hammond (2009) <#id10>`_
------------------------------

Mark Hammond, author and long-term maintainer of the `win32all <http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/>`_ package and `PythonWin <http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/>`_, has been a long-term contributor
to Python. Without his contributions it is likely that the Windows platform
would be a much less significant part of the Python landscape.

Mark created software that made Python immeasurably more valuable to the
Windows community, thereby ensuring that Python was not consigned to the
&quot;Linux/UNIX open source&quot; category.  He also created the first implementation
of Python for Microsoft's .NET environment, was a major contributor to
ActiveState's place in the Python world, and has more recently acted as
Python ambassador to the Mozilla community.

Mark is also (jointly with Andy Robinson) the author of an O'Reilly title,
`Python Programming on Win-32 <http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565926219>`_.

`Martin von L?wis (2008) <#id11>`_
----------------------------------

Martin von L?wis continues to be a tireless worker on behalf of the
Python community.  He has been a long-term contributor to the Python
core, and regularly answers questions on the Python developers' and
users' mailing lists.  A PSF director since 2002, he was also the
prime mover in transitioning the Python development infrastructure
from SourceForge, and has created several Roundup issue trackers for
various areas.  He chaired the PSF Grants Committee, which among other
achievements kept Jython alive when its future looked uncertain.

`Steve Holden (2007) <#id12>`_
------------------------------

   :alt: holden.jpg

In 2003 Steve Holden founded and chaired the first Python community
conference, establishing `PyCon </community/pycon>`_ as the premier event for
Pythonistas in North America.  Steve again chaired `PyCon </community/pycon>`_ in 2004
and 2005.  Steve is the author of **MISSING**, and a
frequent blogger and contributor to the Python newsgroup,
comp.lang.python.  He has served on the Python Software Foundation's
Board of Directors since 2004.  Steve provides consulting and training
services through his company, `Holden Web <http://www.holdenweb.com>`_.

    Although sadly I never met Frank Willison his spirit permeates the
    Python community, and has inspired me in my efforts to serve that
    community.  I am honored to join such a prestigious list of
    recipients.  Thank you.

Prolific writer and community member Alex Martelli was selected as the
recipient of the 2006 Frank Willison Award.  Alex's books include
**MISSING** and the **MISSING** (editor).  Alex has

`Cameron Laird (2004) <#id14>`_
-------------------------------

.. image:: laird.jpg
   :alt: laird.jpg

Cameron Laird is best known in the Python world for his writing: in
1997 he characterized the language for **MISSING** readers as
&quot;reliable&quot;, &quot;suitable for programming in the large&quot;, &quot;clean, modern,
portable, and extensible&quot;, and with &quot;better aesthetics&quot;.  In 1998, he
published the first report on JPython, the first popular
&quot;batteries-included&quot; profile of Python, and began editing the weekly
&quot;Python-URL!&quot; digest.  Subsequent years saw him write about GUI
toolkits, Web frameworks, Stackless, IronPython, Web Services, Pyrex,
Python-focused books, and much more.  He also manages the Tkinter
mailing list, occasionally contributes to specialized extensions
including Pexpect, pysnmp, python-ldap, and so on, and bases much of
the development of his own company, Phaseit,
Inc., on Python.

    I claim an even stronger proposition: Python is the single best
    language for most beginners.  Its applicability is as wide as
    *any* language (yes, including C and Java), and it's quite
    inviting to first-timers.

    --`comp.lang.python, 2001-01-22 
    <http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-January/066697.html>`_

    Python is the single best general-purpose computing language we
    now have--better'n C, or Java, or anything else.

`Fredrik Lundh (2003) <#id15>`_
-------------------------------

Fredrik Lundh is well known by his nickname &quot;effbot&quot;, so named because
of his prolific contributions to the comp.lang.python newsgroup over
the years.  They became so numerous, in fact, that they became the
basis for his book, (the eff-bot guide to) The Python Standard
Library.  Fredrik is also the author of or major contributor to the
PIL, SRE, xmlrpc, Tkinter and Unicode Python packages, among others.
Fredrik is a principal of `Secret Labs AB <http://www.pythonware.com>`_.
