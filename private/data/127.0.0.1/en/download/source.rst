Download Python Sources
=======================

For most Unix systems, you must download and compile the source
code (see the `latest releases </download/releases/>`_).  The same source code
archive can also be used to build the Windows and Mac versions, and
is the starting point for ports to all other platforms.

If you want to help with the Python Project, see the
`Python Developer's Guide </dev/>`_.
