    **Do yourself a favor** and get a `more recent version </download/>`_!

On 13 April 1999, the final version of Python 1.5.2 was released: 

- `Python 1.5.2 sources </ftp/python/src/py152.tgz>`_ (2.5 MB)

- `Python 1.5.2 installer for Windows </ftp/python/win32/py152.exe>`_ (5.0 MB)

- `What's new in 1.5.2? <whatsnew>`_

- `Documentation </doc/1.5.2p2/>`_ (both online and downloadable)

Note: the Python installer for Windows includes the Tcl/Tk 8.0.5
installer.  See the `Tkinter resource guide </topics/tkinter/trouble.html#win>`_
for troubleshooting the Tcl/Tk installation.

COM support and Pythonwin, an IDE built using Windows components.
