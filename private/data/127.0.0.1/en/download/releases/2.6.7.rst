Python 2.6.7
------------

    **Python 2.6.7 has been replaced by a newer security-fix only source release
    of Python**.  Please download `Python 2.6.8 <../2.6.8/>`_ instead.

    **Python 2.6.7** is a security-fix only source release for Python `2.6.6 <../2.6.6/>`_, fixing several reported security issues.  Python 2.6.7 was
    released on June 3, 2011.

    The last binary release of Python 2.6 was `2.6.6 <../2.6.6/>`_.

Python 2.6 is now in security-fix-only mode; no new features are being added,
and no new bug fix releases are planned.  We intend to provide source-only
security fixes for the Python 2.6 series until October 2013 (five years after
the 2.6 final release).  For ongoing maintenance releases, please see the
Python `2.7 <../2.7/>`_ series.  The `NEWS file <NEWS.txt>`_ lists every
change in each alpha, beta, and release candidate of Python 2.6.
