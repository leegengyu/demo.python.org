Python 2.2.2
------------

    *Note:   See `Python 2.2.3 <../2.2.3/>`_ for a patch
    release which supersedes 2.2.2.*

    **Important:** This release is vulnerable to the problem described in
      `security advisory PSF-2006-001 </news/security/PSF-2006-001/>`_
      "Buffer overrun in repr() of unicode strings in wide unicode
      builds (UCS-4)".  This fix is included in
      `Python 2.4.4 <../2.4.4/>`_
      and `Python 2.5 <../2.5/>`_. If you need to remain with Python 2.2,
      there's a patch available from the security advisory page.

We are pleased to announce the release of **Python 2.2.2**, on
October 14, 2002.  This is a bug-fix release for Python
2.2 and supersedes the previous bugfix release,
`Python 2.2.1 <../2.2.1/>`_.

Download the release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Windows** users should download the Windows installer, `Python-2.2.2.exe </ftp/python/2.2.2/Python-2.2.2.exe>`_,
run it and follow the friendly instructions on the screen to complete
the installation.
Windows users may also be interested in Mark
Hammond's `win32all <http://starship.python.net/crew/mhammond/>`_, a collection of Windows-specific extensions including
COM support and Pythonwin, an IDE built using Windows components.

**Linux users** may find source and some binary RPMs on the
`RPM page <rpms>`_. Debian packages are available
directly from the Debian project, under interpreters (new
releases initially appear in unstable).

**Macintosh** users can find binaries and source on 

Jack Jansen's `MacPython page <http://www.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython.html>`_.
(MacOS X users who have a C compiler can also build from the source
tarball below.)

**All others** should download `Python-2.2.2.tgz </ftp/python/2.2.2/Python-2.2.2.tgz>`_, the
source tarball, and do the usual "gunzip; tar; configure; make" dance.

What's New?
~~~~~~~~~~~

This being a bug-fix release, there have been no exciting new features
implemented since 2.2.1 -- just heaps of fixes.

With special dispensation from the "bugfixes only" rule, a brand
new version of the email
package (nee mimelib) is also included: email 2.4.3.

For a partial list of these fixes, please see the `release notes <NEWS.txt>`_, or the ``Misc/NEWS`` file in
the source distribution.

For the full list of changes, you can poke around CVS.
